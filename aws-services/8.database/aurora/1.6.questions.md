# 📘 **Amazon Aurora Redo Log – Complete Q\&A Reference**

---

## ❓ 1. What is Aurora Redo Log and why is it called that?

### ✅ Answer

The **Aurora Redo Log** is a cloud-native version of the traditional **redo/WAL log** found in MySQL and PostgreSQL. It's used to:

- Log changes to data pages.
- Enable crash recovery.
- Synchronize replicas.

It’s called a “redo log” because it stores the **minimal operations needed to "re-do"** page changes after a crash — a term inherited from **MySQL InnoDB**.

Unlike traditional systems that write logs to local disk, Aurora writes them to a **distributed, in-memory storage layer**, decoupling durability and performance from the writer node.

---

## ❓ 2. How do Aurora replicas stay in sync with the writer node with <100ms lag?

### ✅ Answer

Aurora uses a **pull-based replication model**:

1. Writer commits changes by sending redo logs to **Aurora Storage** (memory-based).
2. Writer notifies replicas of new **LSN (Log Sequence Number)**.
3. Replicas **pull the redo logs** from storage (not the writer).
4. Replicas **apply logs to memory**.
5. Replication lag is typically **<100ms** due to:

   - No log shipping over the network.
   - Shared storage visibility.
   - Lightweight notifications.

---

## ❓ 3. Do replicas pull redo logs every 100ms or only when notified?

### ✅ Answer

Replicas do **not** pull every 100ms.

- Aurora is **event-driven**, not interval-based.
- Replicas **react to LSN notifications** from the storage layer.
- They pull and apply logs **as soon as they’re notified**, not on a timer.

This helps minimize both **latency and wasted I/O**, while maintaining high sync rates.

---

## ❓ 4. What happens if replicas receive redo logs rapidly and memory fills up?

### ✅ Answer

If a replica is under **high write pressure**, and its memory buffer is full:

- Aurora triggers **backpressure**: the replica temporarily stops pulling new logs.
- It **lags behind** in LSN but **doesn’t crash**.
- Redo logs are **safely stored** in the Aurora Storage Layer.
- The replica **resumes pulling logs** when resources are available.

This model ensures **no data loss or crash** due to log overflow.

---

## ❓ 5. Do replicas keep pulled redo logs in memory forever?

### ✅ Answer

No. Replicas **do not store redo logs permanently**.

- Logs are held in memory **only temporarily**.
- Replicas apply the logs to memory but **retain them** until a **flush-confirmation** is received from storage.
- Once the storage layer confirms the **logs are flushed to disk**, replicas **discard them**.

This ensures:

- Safety against crashes.
- Memory is **reused efficiently**.
- **No premature eviction** occurs.

---

## ❓ 6. How does Aurora Storage flush redo logs and inform replicas?

### ✅ Answer

Aurora’s **flush mechanism** is **asynchronous**:

1. Redo logs are first stored in **memory (across 6 copies)** in Aurora Storage.
2. **4 out of 6** acknowledgments are enough to confirm a write (commit).
3. Logs are then **eventually flushed to disk**.
4. Once flushed:

   - Aurora **sends a flush-confirmation** to replicas.
   - Replicas **discard logs** from memory safely.

This model balances:

- 💾 **Durability** (after flush).
- ⚡ **Performance** (commit before flush).
- 🧠 **Replica safety** (controlled memory cleanup).

Absolutely! Here's a clean and precise **Q\&A summary** extracted directly from your original topic, with **corrected answers** that reflect Aurora’s actual behavior (pull-based replication, speculative apply, etc.).

---

## ❓ **Q7: How does Aurora handle writes?**

✅ Aurora **does not write full data pages** immediately. Instead, it:

- Generates **redo logs** describing changes.
- Sends them to the **Aurora Storage Layer**, which stores them in **memory across 6 nodes**.
- The logs are eventually used to **rebuild full data pages** asynchronously when needed.

---

## ❓ **Q8: When do data pages get updated in Aurora storage nodes?**

✅ Aurora **writes redo logs first** and **updates data pages asynchronously**.

- This reduces **write amplification** and speeds up commits.
- Data pages are reconstructed **on demand** using redo logs if a query requests them.

---

## ❓ **Q9: How do Aurora read replicas stay in sync?**

✅ Aurora read replicas:

1. Are **not streamed logs** directly from the writer.
2. Are **notified** when a new **Log Sequence Number (LSN)** is available in storage.
3. **Pull redo logs** from the storage layer.
4. **Speculatively apply** logs in memory.
5. Discard logs **only after** storage confirms they’ve been flushed to disk.

---

## ❓ **Q10: Do Aurora read replicas wait for flushed data pages before serving reads?**

❌ No.

✔ Replicas **apply redo logs immediately** in memory, regardless of whether the pages are flushed to disk.

✔ They retain logs in memory **until flush confirmation** is received, then safely discard them.

---

## ❓ **Q11: Does Aurora use eventual consistency for read replicas?**

❌ No.

✔ Aurora ensures **strong read consistency** for committed transactions by:

- Using **pull-based log replication**.
- Not relying on asynchronous page replication.
- Keeping replicas **synchronized within <100ms lag** in most scenarios.

---

## ❓ **Q12: What happens if a read replica fails before data pages are flushed?**

✅ Aurora ensures correctness:

- A new replica can be spun up.
- It **pulls redo logs** from the storage layer (not old data pages).
- Applies logs in memory to reconstruct **up-to-date state**.

---

## ❓ **Q13: What happens if the primary instance fails before flushing pages?**

✅ Aurora automatically promotes the **best read replica**:

- It applies **any unprocessed redo logs** from storage.
- Since logs were **persisted in memory across 6 nodes**, they’re durable.
- The new primary resumes with **no transaction loss**.

## ❓ **Q14: How is Aurora different from traditional RDS replication?**

| Feature                | Traditional RDS      | Aurora                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Write model            | Full-page writes     | **Redo log-based commits**                |
| Replica sync           | Binlog/WAL streaming | **LSN notifications + pull**              |
| Replica apply behavior | Full-page apply      | **Speculative apply + flush tracking**    |
| Read lag               | Seconds              | **<100ms**                                |
| Failover model         | 1–2 minutes          | **\~30 seconds**                          |
| Disk flush on commit   | Required             | **Deferred (commit after memory quorum)** |

---

## ❓ **Q15: What makes Aurora’s redo-log system high performance?**

✅ Key reasons:

- **No disk I/O required on commit** — just 4/6 memory acknowledgments.
- **Write amplification avoided** — no full-page writes.
- **Shared storage** enables centralized log visibility for all replicas.
- **Flush-confirmation protocol** manages memory and consistency.
