# 📊 Amazon Aurora – CloudWatch Metrics

> _Monitor replication lag, connection load, and query responsiveness in real time._

## 🔁 **Replication Lag Metrics (for Aurora Replicas)**

Aurora uses **asynchronous replication** to sync changes from the **writer (primary)** to **reader (replicas)**. Monitoring replication lag ensures data consistency for read operations.

### 🧪 Key Metrics

| Metric                    | What It Tells You                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AuroraReplicaLag`        | ⏱️ Lag (in ms) for a specific replica syncing with the writer |
| `AuroraReplicaLagMaximum` | 🔺 Maximum lag among all replicas                             |
| `AuroraReplicaLagMinimum` | 🔻 Minimum lag among all replicas                             |

> ✅ **Low lag** = fresh reads from replicas  
> ⚠️ **High lag** = stale reads, eventual consistency issues for users

---

### 💡 **Real-World Impact:**

If lag is high, users connected to one replica may **see different data** than others. This is especially critical for apps with:

- **Strong read-after-write consistency requirements**
- **Data-sensitive operations like orders, payments, or logs**

---

## 🔌 **Connection Load**

`DatabaseConnections`: Shows how many **active connections** are open to the instance.

> 🔍 Use this to detect **connection exhaustion**, especially under high traffic or poor connection pooling.

---

## 🐢 **Insert Latency**

`InsertLatency`: Measures the **average duration** of INSERT queries on the database.

> 📉 A spike here may indicate:

- I/O bottlenecks
- Lock contention
- Scaling issues on the primary node

---

## 🛠️ **Best Practices for Monitoring Aurora**

- Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** on:

  - `AuroraReplicaLagMaximum` – alert if lag crosses your SLA threshold
  - `DatabaseConnections` – detect maxing out of connection pool
  - `InsertLatency` – alert on query slowness trends

- Combine with **Performance Insights** for query-level visibility

- Use **RDS Enhanced Monitoring** for OS-level metrics if performance drops
