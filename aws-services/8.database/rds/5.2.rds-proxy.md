## **📌 What is Amazon RDS Proxy?**

Amazon **RDS Proxy** acts as a **middleware layer** between **your applications and RDS databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Aurora).

### **🛠️ Key Functions:**

- ✔ **Connection Pooling** – Reduces **new connection overhead** by reusing active database connections.
- ✔ **Automatic Failover** – **Minimizes downtime** by switching connections to a standby DB during failures.
- ✔ **IAM Authentication** – Secure database access via **AWS IAM** without sharing credentials.
- ✔ **Secrets Manager Integration** – Stores **database credentials securely**, reducing security risks.
- ✔ **Throttling & Connection Control** – Prevents **overloading** the database with excessive connections.

### **❌ Without RDS Proxy – Connection Overhead Issues**

> Without a connection proxy, each application maintains separate, direct connections to the database, leading to **high latency, increased resource usage, and performance bottlenecks**.

### **✅ With RDS Proxy – Optimized Database Connectivity**

> By using **Amazon RDS Proxy**, applications can share a **pooled connection** to the database, reducing **idle connections, resource wastage, and failover delays**.
