# 📡 **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis – Key Metrics to Monitor**

> 🧠 Monitoring Redis is critical for ensuring high availability, low latency, and memory-efficient performance of your caching layer.

---

## 🔁 1. **Evictions**

When Redis runs out of memory, it evicts items to make space.

- **Metric:** `Evictions`
- **What it Means:**
  Items are being **forced out of cache** even though they haven’t expired.
- **Causes:**  
  🔸 Overfilled memory  
  🔸 Inefficient eviction policy
- **Solutions:**  
  ✅ Set a better eviction policy (e.g., LRU – Least Recently Used)  
  ✅ Scale up (bigger nodes) or scale out (add shards/nodes)

> 🔥 **High evictions = data churn = bad cache hit rate**

---

## 🧠 2. **CPUUtilization**

- **Metric:** `CPUUtilization`
- **What it Means:**
  Measures how much of the Redis node’s CPU is being used.
- **Threshold Tip:**

  > 📈 Consistently high CPU can lead to throttling or slow cache responses.

- **Solutions:**  
  ✅ Scale to a higher instance class  
  ✅ Distribute load across more nodes

---

## 💾 3. **SwapUsage**

- **Metric:** `SwapUsage`
- **What it Means:**
  Shows how much memory the OS is pushing to disk.
- **Why It Matters:**
  Redis is **memory-intensive**, and **swapping kills performance**.
- **Best Practice:**

  > ⚠️ **Swap should stay below 50MB**

- **Solutions:**  
  ✅ Ensure enough reserved memory is configured  
  ✅ Resize your node to avoid OS-level swapping

---

## 🔌 4. **CurrConnections**

- **Metric:** `CurrConnections`
- **What it Means:**
  The number of **active and concurrent client connections**
- **When to Watch:**
  Spikes may indicate:

  - 🐛 Bad app behavior (e.g., unclosed connections)
  - 🧠 Poor connection pooling

- **Solutions:**  
  ✅ Investigate app connection logic  
  ✅ Implement connection reuse/pooling

---

## 📈 5. **DatabaseMemoryUsagePercentage**

- **Metric:** `DatabaseMemoryUsagePercentage`
- **What it Means:**
  Percentage of used memory in the Redis node.
- **Why Important:**
  Helps forecast when **you’ll hit memory limits**.
- **Solutions:**  
  ✅ Offload unused data  
  ✅ Scale vertically (larger node) or horizontally

---

## 🌐 6. **Network Throughput & Replication**

### Network Metrics

- `NetworkBytesIn`, `NetworkBytesOut`
- `NetworkPacketsIn`, `NetworkPacketsOut`

Track **traffic in/out of your node**. Spikes may signal usage surges or bottlenecks.

### Replication Metrics

- `ReplicationBytes` – How much data is being copied to replicas
- `ReplicationLag` – How far replicas are **behind the primary**

> ⚠️ High replication lag = **eventual consistency risks**

---

## 🛠️ Best Practices for Redis Monitoring

- 🎯 **Set up CloudWatch Alarms** for key metrics
- 🧠 **Use Enhanced Monitoring** for granular OS stats (via Redis Engine)
- 🔁 **Auto-scaling ElastiCache** clusters based on traffic patterns
- 🧪 Test failovers to ensure your app can tolerate replica lag

## 📌 Final Thoughts

Redis is fast — until it isn't.
📉 Performance degradation typically starts with unmonitored **evictions**, **swap**, or **lag**.

Stay ahead by tracking:

- 🔄 **Evictions**
- 🧠 **CPU + Memory**
- 🌐 **Connections + Replication**
