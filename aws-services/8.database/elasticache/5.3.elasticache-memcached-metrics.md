# 📊 **Memcached Metrics to Monitor**

> _Stay ahead of bottlenecks, optimize performance, and avoid eviction storms._

---

## 🚨 Why Monitoring Matters

Memcached is blazing fast—but only when properly sized and monitored. If your cache is overloaded or misconfigured, performance degrades silently. These metrics help you **detect issues early** and guide scaling decisions.

## 🔍 Key Metrics Breakdown

### 🗃️ **Evictions**

> Number of **non-expired items** evicted to make room for new data.

- ❗ **Why it happens**: Memory full, and Memcached can’t fit new writes.
- ✅ **What to do**:

  - Use an **eviction policy** like LRU (Least Recently Used).
  - Scale **up** (larger node type) or scale **out** (more nodes).

---

### ⚙️ **CPUUtilization**

> How much CPU the node is using.

- 📈 High usage = CPU-bound workload.
- ✅ **What to do**:

  - Choose a **larger instance class** (more vCPU).
  - Use **sharding** or add **more nodes** for load distribution.

---

### 🧠 **SwapUsage**

> Amount of memory swapped to disk (should stay **< 50 MB**).

- 🔥 High swap means memory pressure and **slower performance**.
- ✅ **What to do**:

  - Ensure **reserved memory** is correctly configured.
  - Scale to **larger memory nodes**.

---

### 🌐 **CurrConnections**

> Total **active client connections** to your node.

- 📊 Spikes may indicate sudden application surges.
- ✅ **What to do**:

  - **Profile your application** for connection pooling.
  - Investigate whether clients are **reusing or leaking connections**.

---

### 🧩 **FreeableMemory**

> Amount of **available RAM** on the host.

- 📉 Consistently low = risk of **evictions or swap**.
- ✅ **What to do**:

  - Allocate **more memory per node**.
  - Monitor usage trends and proactively scale.

---

## 📈 Dashboards & Alerts

Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for:

- `Evictions > 0` → Alert on memory overflows
- `SwapUsage > 50MB` → Trigger warning on memory misconfiguration
- `CPUUtilization > 80%` → Indicates CPU saturation
- `FreeableMemory < 100MB` → Running out of room

---

## 🧰 Tip: Use These Metrics Together

No single metric tells the full story. Always monitor:

> `Evictions + FreeableMemory + SwapUsage` together
> to detect whether the node is **memory starved or under pressure**.
