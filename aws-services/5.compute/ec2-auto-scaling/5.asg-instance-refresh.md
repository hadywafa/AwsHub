# 🔄 **EC2 Auto Scaling – Instance Refresh**

The **Instance Refresh** feature in **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** allows you to **automatically replace existing instances** in an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) when you **update the launch template** (e.g., with a new AMI or configuration).

## 🎯 **Why Use Instance Refresh?**

> Instead of manually terminating and replacing instances, Instance Refresh lets you perform **automated rolling updates** to apply new changes — **safely and with zero downtime**.

---

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. ✅ **You update the launch template or launch configuration** (e.g., new AMI).
2. ✅ **You trigger Instance Refresh** via the console, CLI, or API.
3. 🔁 Auto Scaling **gradually replaces instances** using the new configuration.
