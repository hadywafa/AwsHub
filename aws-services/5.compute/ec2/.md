# 🧩 **EC2 Placement Groups**

_Take control of how your instances are placed on AWS infrastructure._

---

## 🤔 **What Are EC2 Placement Groups?**

By default, AWS spreads your instances across racks and hardware for fault tolerance. But when you **need control** over placement — for **low latency**, **hardware isolation**, or **maximum resilience** — that’s where **Placement Groups** come in.

### 🔍 Key Idea

> “Placement Groups define how close (or far apart) EC2 instances are deployed — for performance, redundancy, or both.”

You can pick from **3 types** based on your needs:

| Purpose                     | Use This Group |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| ⚡ High performance         | Cluster        |
| 🧱 Hardware fault isolation | Partition      |
| 🔒 Maximum redundancy       | Spread         |

## 1️⃣ **Cluster Placement Group** – _Performance First_ ⚡

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/cluster-pg.png" alt="Cluster Placement Group" style="border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

### 🧠 What It Does

- Launches **all instances in the same AZ and rack**
- Gives **very low latency** and **high throughput**
- Ideal for **interconnected compute-intensive workloads**

### 🛠️ Use Cases

- HPC (High Performance Computing)
- Real-time analytics
- GPU workloads
- Rendering farms

### 📌 Quick Facts

| Key Factor       | Value                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| 🏗️ AZ Constraint | All instances in one AZ  |
| 🔗 Proximity     | Very close (same rack)   |
| ⚠️ Risks         | If rack fails → all fail |

## 2️⃣ **Partition Placement Group** – _Fault Isolation_ 🧱

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/partition-pg.png" alt="Partition Placement Group" style="border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

### 🧠 What It Does

- Splits instances into **isolated partitions** (hardware groups)
- Ensures **failure in one partition doesn’t affect others**
- **Up to 7 partitions per AZ**

### 🛠️ Use Cases

- HDFS, HBase, Cassandra
- Distributed NoSQL databases
- Hadoop clusters

### 📌 Quick Facts

| Key Factor         | Value                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 🧩 Partition Logic | Instances grouped by zone |
| 🧱 Isolation Level | High (no shared hardware) |
| 🔀 Flexibility     | Multi-AZ supported        |

## 3️⃣ **Spread Placement Group** – _Maximum Resilience_ 🌐

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/spread-pg.png" alt="Spread Placement Group" style="border-radius: 10px;">
</div>

### 🧠 What It Does

- Launches each instance on a **completely separate rack**
- Minimizes **blast radius** of hardware failures
- **Strict limit**: 7 instances per AZ per group

### 🛠️ Use Cases

- High availability systems
- Quorum-based apps (1 failure = major risk)
- Small critical services needing rack-level separation

### 📌 Quick Facts

| Key Factor        | Value                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| 📦 Isolation Type | Rack-level (max separation) |
| 🔁 Multi-AZ       | ✅ Yes                      |
| ⚠️ Limitations    | Max 7 instances per AZ      |

| Feature                  | ⚡ Cluster            | 🧱 Partition                    | 🌐 Spread                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 🚀 AZ Constraint         | Single AZ             | Multi-AZ supported              | Multi-AZ supported             |
| 🔗 Rack Proximity        | Same rack             | Different partitions            | Different racks                |
| 🛠️ Hardware Isolation    | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes (per partition)          | ✅ Max isolation               |
| 🧠 Fault Tolerance       | ❌ Low                | ✅ High                         | ✅✅ Very High                 |
| 📈 Instance Count Limits | No hard limit         | Up to 7 partitions per AZ       | 7 instances per AZ             |
| 📌 Ideal For             | HPC, tight networking | Distributed fault-tolerant apps | Critical, small-scale services |

## 🔄 **Can I Move Instances Between Placement Groups?**

Yes — but with caveats:

### 🛠️ Steps

1. **Stop the instance**
2. **Modify its placement group**
3. **Start the instance again**

### ⚠️ Gotchas

- Not all instance types are supported in all placement groups.
- You can’t move **running** instances — they must be stopped first.

## 🧠 **Real-World Analogy**

| Type      | Real-World Analogy                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster   | All your team working in **one high-speed lab** |
| Partition | Each team is in **a separate building**         |
| Spread    | Each person works in **a separate city**        |

---

## 🏁 **Final Thoughts: Which Should You Use?**

| If you need...                                | Use...        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| ⚡ High-speed communication between instances | **Cluster**   |
| 🧱 Logical fault domains to isolate failures  | **Partition** |
| 🌐 Full isolation for max availability & HA   | **Spread**    |

> Pick the right placement group for **cost-efficiency, fault tolerance**, or **performance** — and you’ll optimize how your EC2 workloads run behind the scenes.
