# 💥 **EC2 Spot Instances** – _Maximum Savings, Minimal Waste_

**Amazon EC2 Spot Instances** let you run workloads at up to **90% discount** compared to On-Demand pricing by using **spare EC2 capacity**.

> 🧠 Think: _“leftover EC2 power” for a fraction of the cost—if you can handle the interruptions._

## 🌟 **Core Highlights**

| Feature                    | Description                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💸 **Cost**                | Up to 90% cheaper than On-Demand                                    |
| ⚠️ **Interruptible**       | Can be **terminated by AWS** with a **2-min warning**               |
| ❌ **No Availability SLA** | Capacity might be **unavailable** when needed                       |
| 🔄 **Flexible**            | Supports diverse **workload patterns** and **fleet configurations** |

---

## 🎯 **Best Use Cases**

🧪 Non-critical and fault-tolerant workloads such as:

- 🛠️ **Batch processing**
- 📊 **Big data analysis**
- 🧬 **Scientific simulations**
- 📝 **Background tasks**
- 🔄 **Containerized workers**
- 🎨 **Rendering jobs**

---

## **🔄 Spot Instance Request Types**

You can choose from different request types when launching Spot Instances, which will determine how the instance behaves when the Spot price changes or capacity is no longer available.

### 🕒 1. **One-Time Request**

- Fills your request **once** and terminates or stops if interrupted.
- Best for **ad hoc** tasks or testing environments.

### 🔁 2. **Persistent Request**

- AWS **automatically reattempts** if interrupted or capacity becomes available.
- Ideal for **resilient, long-running jobs**.

| Feature           | One-Time Request            | Persistent Request              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Duration**      | Until fulfilled or canceled | Remains until manually canceled |
| **Auto-Relaunch** | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                          |
| **Best For**      | Ad-hoc jobs                 | Long-lived, resilient workloads |

## **🚢 Fleet Management**

In the context of **Amazon EC2**, a **fleet** refers to a **group of EC2 instances**—not just one instance—that are launched and managed together to meet a specified **target capacity** using **a mix of instance types**, **purchase options**, and **availability zones**.

Think of it like this:

> 🔧 Instead of managing one EC2 instance at a time, you define a _plan_ (the fleet), and AWS intelligently provisions the best combination of instances to meet your needs.

### **🚀 EC2 Fleet**

- **Can Launch Multiple Instance Types**: EC2 Fleet can launch instances across multiple Availability Zones in one region.
- **Define On-Demand and Spot Capacity**: You can separately define how much On-Demand or Spot capacity you need.
- **Specify Maximum Price**: You can define the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the fleet.
- **API/CLI-Based**: EC2 Fleet can only be launched via CLI, SDKs, and APIs.

### **🚢 Spot Fleet**

A **Spot Fleet** is a collection of Spot Instances and optionally On-Demand Instances. It’s designed to `maintain` the required capacity for your application based on a Spot Instance request.

- **Maintain Target Capacity**: Spot Fleet can replace terminated Spot Instances to `maintain` the required capacity.
- **Mixed Instances**: The Spot Fleet can launch a combination of Spot and On-Demand instances.
- **Spot Capacity Pools**: Spot Fleet selects the best Spot capacity pools to meet the request specifications.

## 📋 **How to Request Spot Instances**

You have two options:

| Method                    | Scope                                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Spot Instance Request** | Single AZ / Subnet                     |
| **Spot Fleet Request**    | Multi-AZ / Multi-type with flexibility |

## 🚨 **Spot Instance Interruption Mechanics**

> AWS can **reclaim Spot instances** anytime—stay prepared!

### 🔔 Interruption Signals

- 2-minute notice via:

  - ✅ EC2 metadata endpoint
  - ✅ Amazon EventBridge (rebalance notifications)

### 💥 Interruption Responses

- ❌ **Terminate** (default)
- ⏸️ **Stop** (EBS-backed only)
- 💤 **Hibernate** (EBS + supported OS only)

---

## 🔁 **Handling Spot Rebalancing**

Use **Amazon EventBridge** to monitor `rebalance-recommendation` events.
Proactively **migrate tasks** to healthy capacity pools before your Spot instance gets interrupted.

## ✅ **Final Summary: Why (and When) to Use Spot?**

| ✅ Pros                             | ⚠️ Cons                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 💸 Massive savings (up to 90%)      | ⛔ Instances can be interrupted anytime |
| 🚀 Mix with EC2/Auto Scaling/Fleets | ❌ Not ideal for mission-critical apps  |
| ♻️ Great for disposable workloads   | 🧠 Requires graceful fault handling     |

---

## 🧠 Smart Tip

> Pair Spot with **Auto Scaling Groups**, **Fargate Spot**, or **Spot Fleet Diversification** for **reliable + cost-effective scale**.
