# 🧪 **Placement Group Behavior: Limits, Exceptions & Smart Examples**

Let’s answer **real-world what-if scenarios** and understand **the behavior and limits** of each placement group type — with examples to make things crystal clear. 💡

---

## ⚡ **1. Cluster Placement Group – What if I Launch Too Many Instances?**

> _“Can Cluster PG handle more instances than available capacity in a rack?”_

### 🔍 Behavior

- All instances in a **Cluster PG** must reside in the **same AZ and same rack**.
- If you **request more instances than AWS can place together**, the request **fails** — **no automatic fallback** to another rack.

### 🧠 Example

You request 30 instances of a compute-heavy type in a Cluster PG, but AWS only has space for 20 on a single rack:

- Result: **Launch fails partially or fully**, depending on how much capacity is available.
- 💡 Use **Capacity Reservations** or **launch templates** to plan ahead.

## 🧱 **2. Partition Placement Group – What Happens with 8+ Instances?**

> _“I thought 7 was the limit — but how do I launch more than that?”_

### 🔍 Behavior

- Each **Partition PG** supports up to **7 partitions per AZ**.
- You **can run more than 7 instances**, but they are **spread across partitions**.
- ✅ **Multiple instances can share the same rack inside a partition.**

### 🧠 Examples

#### ✅ Example A: Launch 21 instances in 3 partitions

- Each partition will hold about 7 instances
- Fault isolation is still respected (each partition isolated)

#### ✅ Example B: Launch 3 instances with `3 partitions`

- Each instance is assigned to a **different partition** (unless you configure otherwise)

#### ❗ Example C: Launch 3 instances with `1 partition`

- All instances go to the **same partition** → less fault isolation

### 🧠 Key Notes

- Each **partition** may include **multiple racks**, but AWS guarantees **no rack sharing between partitions**.
- You control how many partitions are created (manually or via launch config).

## 🌐 **3. Spread Placement Group – Why the 7-Instance Limit per AZ?**

> _“Why limit it to 7 if the AZ has many racks?”_

### 🔍 Behavior

- Each **Spread PG** instance must go to a **separate rack with isolated power, networking, and hardware**.
- AWS **reserves only 7 such ultra-isolated racks per AZ** for this use case.

### 🧠 Real-World Scenario

#### ❌ Launching 8 instances in a Spread PG (1 AZ)

- Result: **Fails** with “Spread placement group limit exceeded”

### 🛠 What You Can Do

| Strategy                      | Outcome                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Create multiple Spread PGs | ✅ But **no guaranteed isolation across groups**                      |
| 🌍 Use multi-AZ spread group  | ✅ 3 AZs = 21 max instances (7 per AZ)                                |
| 🔁 Switch to Partition PG     | ✅ More scalable, with **partition-level (not rack-level)** isolation |

## 🧠 Spread vs. Partition: What’s the Real Difference?

| Feature         | Spread PG                            | Partition PG                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Isolation Level | ✅ One rack per instance             | ✅ No shared hardware between partitions |
| Rack Sharing    | ❌ Never (1 rack per instance)       | ✅ Yes (within the same partition)       |
| Use Case        | Critical apps needing max separation | Large-scale fault-tolerant systems       |
| Scale Limit     | 7 instances per AZ                   | Hundreds of instances across partitions  |
| AZ Span         | ✅ Multi-AZ supported                | ✅ Multi-AZ supported                    |

| Scenario                            | Best Practice                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 💥 Ultra-HA microservice (7 nodes)  | Spread PG (1 node per rack)                          |
| 🧠 Distributed DB (24+ nodes)       | Partition PG (split across 3–7 partitions)           |
| 🚀 GPU-accelerated ML cluster       | Cluster PG (for low-latency between GPUs)            |
| ❗ Need 12 isolated nodes in one AZ | Use 2 Spread PGs across 2 AZs or switch to Partition |
| 🔁 Want to move PG types            | Stop, modify PG, start again (with supported types)  |
