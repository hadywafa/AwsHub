## 🔄 **1. Pending (Launching)**

🟡 **State**: `pending`  
When you launch a new EC2 instance, AWS begins provisioning the hardware, network, and storage.

- ⏳ **Instance not ready yet**
- 💸 **Billing**: _Not billed during this stage_

---

## 🟢 **2. Running**

🟢 **State**: `running`  
The instance is now up and fully operational. You can SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows) into it.

- ✅ Ready to process workloads
- 💸 **Billing**: _You are billed for compute usage_

---

## 🔁 **3. Rebooting**

🔁 **State**: `running` (still)  
The instance restarts at the OS level, but **without stopping or terminating** it.

- 🔧 Used for applying patches or soft resets
- 💸 **Billing**: _Continues, same as running state_

---

## 🟡 **4. Stopping → Stopped**

🟡 **State**: `stopping` → 🔴 `stopped`  
Stopping shuts down the instance safely, but **retains configuration and attached EBS volumes**.

- ✅ You can restart it later
- 🔄 Instance store data (if any) is lost
- 💸 **Billing**:
  - ❌ _No compute billing_
  - ✅ _EBS storage billing continues_

---

## 😴 **5. Hibernate**

### 🧊 **What is EC2 Hibernate?**

EC2 Hibernate allows you to **pause and resume your instance with its in-memory state (RAM) preserved**. When an instance is hibernated:

- 🧠 Application memory, open files, and OS state are saved
- 💾 The RAM contents are written to the **root EBS volume**
- 🚀 Upon restart, the instance **resumes faster** without full OS reboot
- 🔒 The root volume **must be encrypted** to store RAM snapshot

---

### 🛠️ **How It Works**

- `stopping` → `stopped` (but with memory saved to EBS)
- On resume: RAM is reloaded, apps pick up where they left off
- Behind the scenes: RAM is stored in a file on the **encrypted root EBS volume**

### 💡 **Use Cases**

- Long-running processing jobs
- Applications with slow startup times
- Services that depend on memory state

### ✅ **Requirements**

| Category                    | Requirement                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📦 **Instance Families**    | C3, C4, C5, I3, M3, M4, R3, R4, T2, T3, etc.                                 |
| 🧠 **RAM Size**             | Must be **less than 150 GB**                                                 |
| 🧱 **Instance Type**        | Not supported on **bare metal instances**                                    |
| 🧬 **AMI Support**          | Amazon Linux 2, Linux AMI, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, Windows                     |
| 💽 **Root Volume**          | Must be **EBS-based, encrypted, not instance store**, and sufficiently large |
| 🕒 **Hibernation Duration** | Max duration: **60 days**                                                    |

### 🔑 **Enabling Hibernate**

- Must be **enabled at instance launch**
- Set **Stop behavior = Hibernate**

### 💸 **Billing**

- ❌ **No compute charges** during hibernation
- ✅ **EBS billing** applies (storage for memory snapshot + root volume)

---

## 🔴 **6. Stopped**

🔴 **State**: `stopped`  
The instance is shut down completely but **still exists in your account** and is restartable.

- 🧩 EBS-backed root volumes are retained
- 💥 Instance store volumes are erased
- 💸 **Billing**:
  - ❌ _No compute cost_
  - ✅ _EBS cost applies_

---

## ❌ **7. Terminated**

❌ **State**: `terminated`  
The instance is **permanently deleted**. This action cannot be undone.

- 🪓 You lose access completely
- 🧹 Instance store & root volumes are wiped
- 💸 **Billing**:
  - ❌ _No further billing for the instance_
  - ⚠️ _EBS volumes **may persist** and incur charges if not manually deleted_

---

## 🔁 **Lifecycle Flow Summary**

- 1️⃣ **Launch (Pending)** → EC2 instance starts its provisioning process.
- 2️⃣ **Running** → Instance is ready for use.
- 3️⃣ **Reboot** → Restarts the instance without terminating it.
- 4️⃣ **Stop (Stopping → Stopped)** → Temporarily halts the instance (but does not delete it).
- 5️⃣ **Hibernate** → Suspends instance memory to disk before stopping.
- 6️⃣ **Terminate (Terminated)** → The instance is permanently deleted and no longer billed.

## 💸 **Billing Cheat Sheet**

| **State**      | **Compute Charges** | **Storage Charges (EBS)**    |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Pending**    | ❌ No               | ❌ No                        |
| **Running**    | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                       |
| **Rebooting**  | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                       |
| **Stopped**    | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                       |
| **Hibernate**  | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes (includes memory)     |
| **Terminated** | ❌ No               | ⚠️ _Only if EBS not deleted_ |

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- 🔒 **Hibernation is supported only for EBS-backed instances**
- 🧹 **Instance Store**: Temporary storage is **lost** when the instance stops or is terminated
- 🔁 **Stopped vs. Terminated**:
  - _Stopped_ = paused & recoverable
  - _Terminated_ = deleted & gone forever
