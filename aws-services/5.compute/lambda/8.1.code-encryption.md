## 🔐 **2. Enable Encryption with AWS KMS – Secure Deployment Packages**

By default, AWS Lambda **encrypts your code archive** with an **AWS-managed key**. However, you can use a **KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK)** for greater control.

### 📌 **Why Use a Customer Managed Key (CMK)?**

✔️ **Full control** over key rotation and permissions.  
✔️ **Restrict access**—only authorized users can view or update function code.  
✔️ **Meet compliance** and security policies.

### 🔧 **How to Use KMS Encryption**

1. **Create a KMS Key** in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
2. **Attach the KMS key to the Lambda function** to encrypt the deployment package.

**AWS CLI Example:**

```sh
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name myFunction \
  --kms-key-arn arn:aws:kms:region:account-id:key/your-key-id
```

💡 **Best Practice:** Store secrets (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in **AWS Secrets Manager**, not in environment variables.
