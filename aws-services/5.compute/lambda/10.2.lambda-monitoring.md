# 📈 **Lambda Monitoring with CloudWatch – From Metrics to Insights**

> _Know exactly what your Lambda is doing, when it breaks, and how to fix it – all through CloudWatch._

---

## 📊 **Lambda CloudWatch Metrics (Automatic)**

These are **pushed by AWS** every time your Lambda runs:

| 📌 Metric                | 📘 Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Invocations**          | Number of times the function is called (success or failure)   |
| **Duration**             | Time (ms) your function runs from trigger to finish           |
| **Errors**               | Number of failed invocations (exceptions, timeouts, etc.)     |
| **Throttles**            | Invocations that were blocked due to concurrency limits       |
| **DeadLetterErrors**     | Failed attempts to send an event to DLQ for async invocations |
| **IteratorAge**          | Age of the latest record in stream before Lambda processes it |
| **ConcurrentExecutions** | Number of Lambda workers running simultaneously               |

### 🧠 **Example CloudWatch Alarm Use Cases**

| 🔔 Alarm Name        | 📌 Trigger Condition                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `NoInvocations`      | No Lambda calls in last hour (🕐 inactivity alert)    |
| `LambdaErrorsAlarm`  | If `Errors > 0` → notify DevOps                       |
| `HighThrottlesAlarm` | If `Throttles > 0` → increase concurrency or optimize |

## 📄 **Lambda Logs – CloudWatch Logs**

Every Lambda logs to a dedicated **log group**:

```ini
/aws/lambda/your-function-name
```

- Each **log stream** contains one execution’s output
- Requires Lambda role permission:

```json
("logs:CreateLogGroup", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents")
```

## 🔍 **CloudWatch Logs Insights – Powerful Log Search**

Use structured queries to:

- Filter 🔎 logs
- Count ❌ errors
- Investigate cold starts 🥶
- Detect timeouts ⏳

📋 Example:

```sql
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /ERROR/
| sort @timestamp desc
```

## 📊 **Lambda Insights – Enhanced Monitoring**

> Advanced metrics via **CloudWatch Lambda Extension**.

✅ Lambda Insights provides:

| 📈 Metric Type           | 🔍 Examples                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **System Metrics**       | CPU, memory, network, disk                    |
| **Function Diagnostics** | Cold starts, shutdown reason, memory max used |
| **Networking**           | Bytes sent/received                           |

📦 Output appears under `/aws/lambda-insights/...`
Includes structured JSON like:

```json
{
  "function_name": "cpu-intensive",
  "duration": 45191,
  "cold_start": true,
  "timeout": true,
  "shutdown_reason": "Timeout",
  "used_memory_max": 63,
  ...
}
```
