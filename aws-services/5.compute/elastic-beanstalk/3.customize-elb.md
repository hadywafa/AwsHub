# 🛠️ **Customize EB with `.ebextensions`**

`.ebextensions` is your gateway to **configure**, **extend**, and **control** your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

🧩 It's a folder inside your deployable ZIP bundle that includes `*.config` files written in **YAML or JSON**, following a **CloudFormation-style syntax**.

## 📁 Folder structure

```ini
my-app.zip
├── .ebextensions/
│   ├── 01-env-vars.config
│   └── 02-custom-setup.config
├── app.js
└── package.json
```

## ⚙️ `.config` File Breakdown

### ✅ 1. `option_settings`

Used to set config values for:

- Platform settings (like PHP memory limit)
- Env vars
- EC2 instance type
- Health check URL

```yaml
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    MY_VAR: "value"
  aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration:
    InstanceType: t3.small
```

---

### 📦 2. `packages`, `sources`, `files`, `commands`

Used to:

- Install packages (yum, apt)
- Download files
- Write files
- Run shell commands on EC2

```yaml
packages:
  yum:
    git: []

commands:
  01_install:
    command: "npm install -g pm2"
```

---

### 🔧 3. `Resources`

You can define **new AWS resources** (like S3 buckets, SNS topics) inside the EB stack using CloudFormation-style `Resources`.

```yaml
Resources:
  MyTopic:
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
    Properties:
      TopicName: my-eb-topic
```

---

### 🚀 4. `container_commands`

Runs **after the app is extracted** but **before the server starts**.

Useful for:

- Running `npm install`, `dotnet build`, etc.

```yaml
container_commands:
  01_npm_install:
    command: "npm install"
    leader_only: true
```

> 🧠 `leader_only: true` ensures it only runs on one instance during deploys.
