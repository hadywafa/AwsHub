# 🧬 **Cloning Elastic Beanstalk Environments**

Cloning allows you to **duplicate an EB environment** with:

- Same code version
- Same platform
- Same scaling & configuration

## 🧪 Use Case

Test new changes in a **staging clone** of production.

```bash
eb clone my-prod-env
```

💡 Notes:

- ✅ Copies env vars, instance configs, scaling rules
- ❌ Doesn’t copy **RDS data**
- ❌ Doesn’t clone unmanaged changes (like manual EC2 tweaks)

> 🧠 Best for **blue/green deployments**, troubleshooting, testing changes.
