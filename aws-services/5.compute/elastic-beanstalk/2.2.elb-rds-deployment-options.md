# 💾 **Elastic Beanstalk + RDS: All Deployment Options Explained**

Elastic Beanstalk does **not manage your database** directly — it just connects to one. But the way you create and connect your RDS instance matters **a lot** depending on your goals (like preserving data).

Let’s break down each option 💥

---

## ☝️ Option 1 – **RDS Created _Inside_ the EB Environment**

| ✅ Pros                      | ❌ Cons                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Automatic setup              | **Tightly coupled** to EB environment    |
| Easy connection via env vars | `Deleting EB = deleting your database` |
| Simple for dev/test          | Not safe for production                  |

🧠 **What happens?**

- When you create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment (via Console or CLI), you can **enable a database** (e.g., RDS MySQL).
- EB provisions an **RDS instance automatically**, and injects env vars like:

  ```bash
  RDS_HOSTNAME, RDS_PORT, RDS_USERNAME, RDS_PASSWORD
  ```

- EB links this RDS to your environment **stack (CloudFormation)**.

🔥 **BUT**: When you delete the environment (even by mistake), AWS deletes the **entire stack**, including the database — 🔥 **data loss!**

> 🧪 **Best for**: Dev/test environments where you don’t mind wiping the DB when the app is gone.

## ✌️ Option 2 – **RDS Created _Outside_ of EB (Recommended for Production)**

| ✅ Pros                                   | ❌ Cons                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Persistent data** even if EB is deleted | Must manually provision RDS  |
| Use snapshots, scaling, backups           | Slightly more setup upfront  |
| Supports multiple EB envs                 | Not included in EB lifecycle |

🧠 **What happens?**

- You manually create an RDS instance using:
  - AWS Console
  - CloudFormation
  - Terraform
  - or CLI (`aws rds create-db-instance`)
- You then connect it by injecting **custom environment variables** into your EB app:

  ```bash
  RDS_HOSTNAME = mydb.abcdefg1234.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
  RDS_USERNAME = myuser
  RDS_PASSWORD = mypass
  ```

- These are added either via:
  - Console → Configuration → Environment properties
  - `.ebextensions` (we’ll explain next)
  - `eb setenv` command

✅ **Data is preserved** even if EB is terminated. You can reuse the RDS across multiple EB environments.

> 🧪 **Best for**: Production, staging, or any environment where **data durability** is critical.

## 🤟 Option 3 – **Manual Recovery Plan (Blue/Green + Snapshot Backup)**

This is your **disaster recovery & upgrade strategy**. Combine EB lifecycle control + RDS snapshots.

📌 **When to use this?**

- You want to deploy a **new version** of your EB app safely (blue/green)
- You want to **keep the same database**
- You want to **terminate old EB env** and clean up safely

### 🧭 Steps

1. 📸 **Snapshot** your RDS

   ```bash
   aws rds create-db-snapshot --db-instance-identifier mydb --db-snapshot-identifier mydb-snap
   ```

2. 🔐 **Enable Delete Protection** on RDS (so even if EB tries to delete it, it fails)

3. 🆕 **Create a new EB environment** (new version of your app)

4. 🔌 In the new EB env, configure the same `RDS_HOSTNAME`, `USERNAME`, etc. (point to old DB)

5. 🔁 **Swap the CNAME** between old and new EB envs

   ```bash
   eb swap --source-env old-env --dest-env new-env
   ```

6. 🧹 **Delete old EB environment**

   > Note: You may get `DELETE_FAILED` if EB tries to delete the RDS. That’s fine — go to CloudFormation → choose to _retain_ the RDS resource.

> 🧪 **Best for**: Safe production migrations, disaster recovery, and preserving RDS across version swaps.
