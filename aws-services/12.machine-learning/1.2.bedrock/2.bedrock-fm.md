# 🧠 Amazon Bedrock – Base Foundation Models (FMs)

## 📜 What are Base Foundation Models?

> In Amazon Bedrock, **Base Foundation Models (FMs)** are **pre-trained AI models** built by top AI companies (AWS, Anthropic, Meta, Stability AI, etc.) that you can **use as-is** or **customize** for your own applications — all without needing to build or train them yourself.

✅ Think of them as **"ready-to-go brains"** 🧠 that you can plug into your apps.

## 🧩 How to Choose a Base Model?

Choosing the right Foundation Model depends on **several important factors**:

| Factor                  | What to Consider                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📚 Model Type           | Text generation, image generation, embeddings, multimodal?              |
| 🚀 Performance          | Speed, quality of output, precision needed                              |
| 🎯 Capabilities         | Creative writing? Summarization? Translation? Reasoning?                |
| 🔒 Compliance           | Industry-specific requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)?                     |
| 🧠 Customization        | Can you fine-tune it with your own data easily?                         |
| 📏 Model Size           | Larger models = better reasoning, but higher cost and latency           |
| 🏗️ Inference Options    | Real-time vs batch vs asynchronous generation                           |
| 📜 Licensing Agreements | Open-source (free) vs commercial (restricted use and pricing)           |
| ⏳ Context Window Size  | How much text can the model "see" at once? (affects long conversations) |
| ⚡ Latency Requirements | Need fast responses or can tolerate some delay?                         |

## 🎯 Key Model Categories in Bedrock

| Category             | Example Use Case                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 📝 Text Models       | Generate text, summarize articles, chatbots                  |
| 🖼️ Image Models      | Create new images from text prompts (e.g., Stable Diffusion) |
| 🔀 Multimodal Models | Handle both text + image input/output together               |
| 🔍 Embedding Models  | Turn text into vectors for search or retrieval (RAG)         |
