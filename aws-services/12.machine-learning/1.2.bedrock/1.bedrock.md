## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

- **Data stays private** (your inputs/outputs are not used to retrain models unless you explicitly allow it).
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management)** integrations.
- **VPC** and encryption controls to isolate your workloads.
- Complies with major standards (HIPAA, GDPR, SOC 2, etc.).

## 📜 Example: Bedrock API Request (Simplified)

```bash
POST /invoke-model
{
  "modelId": "anthropic.claude-v2",
  "contentType": "application/json",
  "inputText": "Summarize this article about climate change."
}
```

➡️ **Response** will contain a **generated summary** without you needing to install, fine-tune, or manage any server.
