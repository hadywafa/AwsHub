# 🎯 4. Hyperparameter Tuning in SageMaker

## 🧠 What is Hyperparameter Tuning?

> **Definition**:  
> **Hyperparameter Tuning** is the process of **finding the best set of hyperparameter values**  
> to make your ML model perform **as accurately and efficiently as possible**.

📌 **Simply**:

- Hyperparameters = Model settings you define before training 🎛️.
- Tuning = Searching for the **best combination** of those settings to **maximize performance**.

📌 **Common Hyperparameters**:

| Hyperparameter          | Meaning                         |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Learning Rate           | How fast the model updates      |
| Batch Size              | How many samples per update     |
| Number of Layers        | Depth of the neural network     |
| Regularization Strength | How much to prevent overfitting |

📌 **Without tuning**:

- You may have a **working model** but not the **best possible model**. ❌

## 🛠️ What is Automatic Model Tuning (AMT)?

> **Definition**:  
> **Automatic Model Tuning (AMT)** is a feature in SageMaker that **automatically searches** for the best combination of hyperparameters —  
> so you don’t have to do it manually!

📌 **Key Features**:

- Define **ranges** for hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate between 0.01 and 0.1).
- Choose an **objective metric** to optimize (like accuracy or RMSE).
- SageMaker **runs many training jobs**, trying different combinations.
- **Finds the best model** according to your goal 🎯.

📌 **Why it's powerful**:

| Advantage      | Benefit                                         |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Saves time     | No need to manually run hundreds of experiments |
| Saves money    | Stops early if a combination is not promising   |
| Smarter search | Uses Bayesian Optimization or Random Search     |
| Better models  | Often beats manually tuned models               |

📌 **Real-World Example**:

- Instead of manually testing different batch sizes, learning rates, and epochs →  
  Let AMT run 100+ experiments in parallel — and **automatically find the winner** 🏆.

## 🎯 What is an Objective Metric?

> **Definition**:  
> The **Objective Metric** is the number SageMaker tries to **optimize** during tuning.

📌 **Examples**:

| Metric                     | Task                                   |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |
| Accuracy                   | Classification                         |
| F1 Score                   | Classification with imbalanced classes |
| Mean Squared Error (MSE)   | Regression                             |
| Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) | Classification Quality                 |
| Loss                       | General metric for model training      |

📌 **Important**:

- **Maximize** or **minimize** depending on the metric:
  - Accuracy ➔ **maximize** 🎯.
  - Loss ➔ **minimize** 🎯.

📌 **Setting the objective**:
When creating a tuning job, you tell SageMaker:

- Which metric to optimize (e.g., validation-accuracy).
- Whether to maximize or minimize it.

## 🔍 Hyperparameter Search Strategies

📌 SageMaker offers smart strategies to search for the best hyperparameters:

| Strategy              | How it Works                                         | Best When                               |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Grid Search           | Try **every combination** systematically             | Small search spaces                     |
| Random Search         | Try **random combinations** of hyperparameters       | Large search spaces                     |
| Bayesian Optimization | Learn from previous runs to guess better next trials | Complex spaces, expensive training jobs |

📌 **Notes**:

- **Grid Search** guarantees exploring all options (but costly).
- **Random Search** explores wide areas (efficient for large spaces).
- **Bayesian Optimization** is **smartest**: learns as it goes.

## 💸 How AMT Saves Time and Money

📌 **Time Savings**:

| Without AMT                    | With AMT                                      |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Manually tweak hyperparameters | SageMaker tries hundreds automatically        |
| Manually evaluate results      | SageMaker selects best one based on objective |
| Trial-and-error guessing       | Intelligent optimization strategies           |

📌 **Money Savings**:

| Without AMT                        | With AMT                                |
| :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Wasted compute on bad combinations | Stops early if combination looks bad    |
| Pay for slow manual experiments    | Fast parallel tuning cuts training time |
| Over-provisioned resources         | Autoscaled and optimized job runs       |

📌 **Real Example**:

- Without AMT: You might waste \$500 on trial-and-error.
- With AMT: Spend \$100 intelligently to get a better model!
