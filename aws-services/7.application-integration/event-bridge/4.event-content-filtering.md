# 🧠 **Amazon EventBridge Content Filtering**

> _Filter and route events precisely – no need to process irrelevant data._

---

## 🚪 **What is Content Filtering in EventBridge?**

**Content filtering** allows you to match **specific content fields** in your event payload using rules, so only the **events you care about** trigger a target action.

> 🎯 Instead of filtering inside your Lambda or Step Function, you let EventBridge do it _before_ routing.

---

## 🎯 **Why Use It?**

- Reduce **Lambda invocations** (and cost)
- Keep **rules clean and scalable**
- Decouple logic from your application
- Handle **complex routing scenarios** with ease

---

## 🔧 **Filter Syntax**

Rules in EventBridge use **JSON pattern matching** based on fields in the event.
Supports:

- Exact string match
- Prefix match
- Numeric comparison
- Anything-but
- Null match
- List of values

---

## ✍️ **Example Event Structure**

```json
{
  "source": "my.app",
  "detail-type": "order_event",
  "detail": {
    "orderId": "A123",
    "status": "SHIPPED",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

---

## 🛠️ **Hands-On: Build a Filtered Event Rule**

### ✅ Step 1: Create the Rule

Go to **EventBridge Console > Rules > Create Rule**

### Rule Name

```plaintext
ship-order-high-priority
```

### Event Pattern

```json
{
  "source": ["my.app"],
  "detail-type": ["order_event"],
  "detail": {
    "status": ["SHIPPED"],
    "priority": ["high"]
  }
}
```

✅ This will only match events where:

- The source is `my.app`
- The status is `SHIPPED`
- The priority is `high`

### Target

Choose **SNS**, **Lambda**, or even a **Step Function**.

---

## 🔬 **Other Filtering Examples**

### 📌 Match by multiple values

```json
"status": ["SHIPPED", "DELIVERED"]
```

### 🧃 Prefix match

```json
"orderId": [{ "prefix": "A" }]
```

### 🚫 Anything-but match

```json
"priority": [{ "anything-but": ["low"] }]
```

### 🔢 Numeric comparison (with `numeric`)

```json
"price": [{ "numeric": [">", 100] }]
```

> You can chain this for ranges:

```json
"price": [{ "numeric": [">", 100, "<=", 500] }]
```

---

## 🧪 **Test with CLI**

### Put test event

```bash
aws events put-events --entries '[
  {
    "Source": "my.app",
    "DetailType": "order_event",
    "Detail": "{\"orderId\":\"A123\",\"status\":\"SHIPPED\",\"priority\":\"high\"}",
    "EventBusName": "default"
  }
]'
```

✅ You’ll see this event routed only if it matches the rule filters.

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- 🔄 Combine with **Dead Letter Queues** to capture failed events.
- 🧱 Use **multiple rules** for different services (e.g., `priority=high` goes to PagerDuty).
- 🧵 For dynamic filters, consider **custom event buses** per use case.

## 📊 Visual Summary

| Filter Type  | Example                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Exact match  | `"status": ["SHIPPED"]`                     |
| Prefix       | `"orderId": [{ "prefix": "A" }]`            |
| Numeric      | `"price": [{ "numeric": [">", 100] }]`      |
| Anything-but | `"priority": [{ "anything-but": ["low"] }]` |
| Null check   | `"discountCode": [{ "exists": false }]`     |
