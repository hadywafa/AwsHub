# ðŸ’° **Pricing**

Amazon SQS offers a simple and cost-effective pricing model based on usage, ensuring you only pay for what you use.

## ðŸ“Š **Pricing Components:**

1. **Requests:**

   - **Standard Queues:** \$0.40 per million requests.
   - **FIFO Queues:** \$0.50 per million requests.

2. **Payload:**

   - **Standard Queues:** Each **64 KB chunk** of payload is considered **one request**.
   - **FIFO Queues:** Similar pricing applies with slight differences based on throughput and features.

3. **Data Transfer:**
   - **Outbound Data:** Charges apply for data transferred out of AWS regions.
   - **Inbound Data:** Typically free, but always refer to the [AWS SQS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/pricing/) for detailed information.

## ðŸ“Œ **Cost Considerations:**

- **Batch Operations:**

  - **Efficiency:** Sending or receiving messages in batches can optimize costs by reducing the number of API requests.
  - **Example:** Sending 10 messages in a single batch counts as 10 requests, same as sending them individually.

- **FIFO Queues:**

  - **Higher Cost:** Due to advanced features like exactly-once processing and strict ordering, FIFO queues are priced slightly higher than Standard queues.

- **Data Transfer:**
  - **Monitor Costs:** Especially if your application involves significant outbound traffic, keep an eye on data transfer costs.

## ðŸ’¡ **Example Calculation:**

- **Scenario:**

  - **Queue Type:** Standard
  - **Messages Sent:** 5 million per month
  - **Message Size:** 128 KB (counts as 2 requests per message)

- **Calculation:**

  - **Requests Cost:** 5M messages Ã— 2 requests = 10M requests

    - 10M Ã— $0.40 / 1M = **$4.00\*\*

  - **Total Monthly Cost:** **\$4.00**
