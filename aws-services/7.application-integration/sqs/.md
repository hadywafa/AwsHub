# 🎯📬 **Amazon SQS Temporary Queues (Virtual Queues) – Simplified**

> SQS **Temporary Queues** (also known as **Virtual Queues**) allow you to **simulate short-lived queues** without actually creating/deleting many physical SQS queues — they **use tags on a shared FIFO queue** under the hood.

---

## 💡 What Are Temporary (Virtual) Queues?

Imagine you're building a **chat system**, **checkout process**, or **request/response model** where you need a **temporary reply queue** for a specific task or session.

✅ Instead of creating a **real SQS queue per session**, you can use **Virtual Queues**:

- They behave like **temporary personal queues** (e.g., one per user/session)
- But they're **implemented as tags** on a **shared underlying FIFO queue**

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant VirtualQueue
    participant SharedQueue
    participant Consumer

    Client->>VirtualQueue: Send Message (tagged with virtual queue ID)
    VirtualQueue->>SharedQueue: Message added with tag
    Consumer->>SharedQueue: Poll messages
    Consumer->>VirtualQueue: Route message to correct client (by tag)
    Client-->>Consumer: Receives response
```

- All messages are **sent to a shared FIFO queue**.
- Each message includes a **tag identifying its virtual queue** (like a session ID).
- The **SQS Virtual Queue Client SDK** filters and routes messages to the **correct temporary consumer**.

## 📦 Real-World Analogy

> 🏢 Imagine one giant office building (shared FIFO queue)  
> 🧍 Each person (virtual queue) has their **own inbox in the building**  
> 📬 Mail arrives tagged with the person’s name → it's routed to the right inbox  
> ✅ You only manage **one building**, but many people use it

## 🧰 When Should I Use Temporary Queues?

| Use Case                         | Use Temporary Queues? |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| ✅ Short-lived response queues   | ✅ Yes                |
| ✅ Chatbots, checkout sessions   | ✅ Yes                |
| ✅ Request/response messaging    | ✅ Yes                |
| ❌ Long-term queue processing    | ❌ No                 |
| ❌ Durable message storage       | ❌ No                 |
| ❌ High isolation between queues | ❌ Prefer real queues |

---

## 🎯 Example Use Cases

### 🧾 1. **Request/Response Pattern**

- A user sends a request → waits for a reply
- You attach a **temporary virtual queue** to capture the response

> Like `Reply-To` in emails

---

### 💬 2. **Per-session Messaging**

- You don’t want to create one SQS queue per customer
- Instead, use **virtual queues** identified by `session-123`

---

## 🔧 How to Use It (Java Only)

The **SQS Temporary Queue Client** is available in the **AWS Java SDK**:

```java
AmazonSQS sqs = AmazonSQSClientBuilder.defaultClient();
AmazonSQSVirtualQueues virtualQueues = AmazonSQSVirtualQueuesClientBuilder
    .builder()
    .withAmazonSQS(sqs)
    .build();

CreateVirtualQueueRequest request = new CreateVirtualQueueRequest()
    .withQueueName("my-session-queue")
    .withParentQueueArn("arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:my-shared.fifo");

String virtualQueueUrl = virtualQueues.createVirtualQueue(request);
```

> The virtual queue is **created in memory**, not as an actual SQS resource!

## 🔐 Important Notes

| Limitation                   | Explanation                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Java SDK only                | Temporary queues are supported in **Java SDK** only |
| FIFO only                    | Requires a **shared FIFO queue**                    |
| Visibility timeout matters   | If your app crashes, messages may be lost           |
| Not persisted in AWS Console | Virtual queues are **in-memory** concepts           |

## 🧠 Summary – When to Use Temporary Queues

| Feature                       | Temporary Queues        | Real SQS Queues         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Short-lived sessions          | ✅ Great fit            | ❌ Overkill             |
| Durable, long-term messaging  | ❌ Not suitable         | ✅ Use real queues      |
| Fast setup, no queue creation | ✅ Instant              | ❌ Slower               |
| Console visibility            | ❌ None (Java-only SDK) | ✅ Full AWS Console     |
| Ideal for                     | Request/response flows  | Batch/message pipelines |

## 📝 Final Thoughts

> Use **SQS Temporary Queues** when you need:

- Quick, per-user or per-session **reply queues**
- **Minimal setup** and **high scale** without creating tons of queues
- You're okay with SDK-based filtering and **Java-only support**
