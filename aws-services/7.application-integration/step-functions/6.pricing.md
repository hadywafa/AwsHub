# 💰 **AWS Step Functions Pricing – Standard vs Express Workflows**

AWS Step Functions lets you coordinate distributed applications using workflows. But how much does it cost? That depends on whether you choose **Standard** or **Express** workflows.

---

## 🟧 **Standard Workflows (Durable, Long-Running)**

Designed for **mission-critical**, long-duration workflows with **exactly-once execution** and detailed execution history.

### 📦 **Pricing Breakdown**

- **💡 State Transitions**: Each time a state is entered (e.g., a Lambda call), it counts as **1 state transition**.
- **✅ Free Tier**:

  - First **4,000 state transitions/month** are free.

- **💵 Paid Usage**:

  - **\$0.025 per 1,000 transitions** after the free tier.

- **🔁 Retries & Catch blocks**: Also counted as additional state transitions.

### 🧮 **Example:**

A 10-step workflow executed 1,000 times per month =
🧮 `10 x 1,000 = 10,000 transitions`
You pay for: `10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000` →
💵 `6,000 ÷ 1,000 x $0.025 = $0.15`

---

## 🟩 **Express Workflows (High-Speed, High-Volume)**

Optimized for **event-driven**, **short-lived**, and **high-throughput** use cases.

### 📦 **Pricing Breakdown**

You are charged based on:

1. **📥 Number of Requests**

   - \$1.00 per **1 million executions**

2. **⏱️ Duration**

   - Billed in 100ms intervals
   - \$0.000004 per **GB-second**

3. **🧠 Memory Consumption**

   - Memory billed in 64 MB increments
   - Formula: `(Memory in GB) x (Execution Duration in Seconds)`

### 🧮 **Example:**

- You run 1 million executions (each 500ms, using 128MB):

  - **Duration charge**: 0.5 sec × 0.125 GB × 1M × \$0.000004 = \$0.25
  - **Request charge**: 1M × \$0.000001 = \$1.00
  - 💵 **Total**: **\$1.25 for 1 million short tasks**

---

## 🔗 **Additional Charges**

Step Functions may invoke **other AWS services** like:

- 🧠 **AWS Lambda**
- 🗄️ **Amazon S3**
- 🧾 **DynamoDB**
- 🔔 **SNS/SQS**

👉 **You pay for those services separately** based on their own pricing models.
