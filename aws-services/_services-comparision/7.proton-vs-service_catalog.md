# **AWS Proton 🆚 AWS Service Catalog**

> _Both manage infrastructure — but for very different goals, teams, and workflows._

## 🧠 **Quick One-Liner Difference**

| 🛠️                  | **AWS Proton**                                                     | **AWS Service Catalog**                                                      |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Purpose          | Standardize **application** deployments (microservices/serverless) | Standardize **any IT infrastructure** (VMs, databases, apps)                 |
| 👩‍💻 Target Users     | **Developers** deploying code + infrastructure                     | **End-users** (Dev, Ops, Business users) provisioning pre-approved resources |
| 🏗️ Focus            | Full app lifecycle (infra + code + CI/CD)                          | Just provisioning approved infrastructure, not managing code                 |
| ⚙️ Templates        | Environment + Service Templates (Proton-native)                    | Products defined by CloudFormation (you bring IaC)                           |
| 🏛️ Platform Control | Platform Engineers control how apps are deployed                   | IT Admins control what resources can be launched                             |

## 📦 **What AWS Proton Really Does**

**AWS Proton** is a **platform for platform teams**.

- Platform engineers define **versioned templates** for:
  - Environment setup (VPC, EKS, ECS)
  - Service setup (Lambda, Fargate, APIs)
- Developers **self-service deploy** apps using these templates.
- Proton **manages the app's lifecycle** (updates, patches, rollouts).
- Proton integrates **infra + CI/CD pipelines** **automatically**.
- Designed mainly for **modern architectures**: microservices, containers, serverless.

> 🧠 **Proton = Application Platform Automation**

## 🛒 **What AWS Service Catalog Really Does**

**AWS Service Catalog** is a **shopping portal for pre-approved AWS resources**.

- IT Admins create **portfolios** of products:
  - EC2 instances
  - RDS databases
  - Full networking stacks
- End users (developers, analysts, ops) **browse and launch** these services easily.
- It’s focused **only on provisioning resources**.
- There’s **no app lifecycle management** (no pipeline building, no code updates).
- Service Catalog covers **any resource type** — **traditional IT** and **cloud-native**.
