| :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧱 **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** | Protects **web apps** by filtering **HTTP/S requests** at **Layer 7** (Application Layer).                             |
| 🔥 **AWS Network Firewall**               | Protects your **entire network** by filtering **all IP-based traffic** at **Layer 3 and 4** (Network/Transport Layer). |

✅ **One guards your web app**  
✅ **One guards your entire VPC network**

## 🎯 **Purpose of Each Service**

| Feature            | AWS WAF                                      | AWS Network Firewall                                                     |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎯 Focus           | Protect websites, APIs, and apps             | Protect entire VPC subnets, private workloads, egress/ingress            |
| 🎯 Typical Threats | SQL injection, XSS, bot attacks, HTTP floods | Port scanning, malware C&C traffic, unauthorized protocols, VPC breaches |
| 🎯 Traffic Type    | HTTP and HTTPS requests only                 | All IP packets (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)                                    |

✅ Different attack surfaces = Different defenses.

## 🧠 **Where They Work in OSI Model**

| Layer                 | AWS WAF | AWS Network Firewall                                   |
| :-------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Layer 3 (Network)     | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes                                                 |
| Layer 4 (Transport)   | ❌ No   | ✅ Yes                                                 |
| Layer 7 (Application) | ✅ Yes  | 🔶 Limited (some L7 app protocols like DNS inspection) |

✅ WAF = Application-layer guardian  
✅ Network Firewall = Packet-level guardian

## 🔍 **How Traffic Flows (Request Lifecycle)**

|     | AWS WAF                                                 | AWS Network Firewall                                                  |
| :-- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | User makes request to DNS (Route 53)                    | User makes request to DNS (Route 53)                                  |
| 2️⃣  | Route 53 resolves to ALB                                | Route 53 resolves to VPC (Firewall Subnet)                            |
| 3️⃣  | Request reaches ALB → WAF checks HTTP/S request content | Traffic flows first through Network Firewall (IP/port/protocol check) |
| 4️⃣  | WAF decides Allow/Block based on rules                  | Network Firewall decides Allow/Drop based on rules                    |
| 5️⃣  | Allowed traffic goes to EC2/ECS/Lambda                  | Allowed traffic goes to ALB/API Gateway then EC2/ECS                  |

✅ **WAF sits attached to ALB**  
✅ **Network Firewall sits attached to VPC routing**

## ✨ **Key Feature Differences**

| Feature               | AWS WAF                                        | AWS Network Firewall                                                  |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👀 Traffic visibility | HTTP header, query string, body inspection     | IP packet headers, protocol fields, payload inspection                |
| ⚙️ Rules              | WAF Web ACLs (SQLi, XSS, GeoBlock, Rate limit) | Stateless (IP/Port) and Stateful (Deep packet inspection) rule groups |
| 🚪 Entry Point        | Attached to ALB, CloudFront, API Gateway       | Routed via Subnets in VPC Route Table                                 |
| 🛠️ Setup Complexity   | Very simple (attach to ALB)                    | Needs VPC route adjustments (more architecture change)                |
| 🧱 Managed Rules      | Available (AWS Managed Rules for WAF)          | Available (AWS Managed Threat Signatures)                             |
| 🌍 Geo-Blocking       | Yes (based on IP country)                      | Yes (IP filtering globally or regionally)                             |

✅ AWS WAF is usually **easier** to deploy  
✅ AWS Network Firewall is usually **deeper** and **stronger** for network-wide security

## 🏆 **Final Smart Pro Tip**

> 🧠 **In real-world architectures, you usually deploy BOTH AWS WAF and AWS Network Firewall together.**

- 🌐 WAF = Guard your public-facing apps (HTTP/S).
- 🔥 Network Firewall = Guard your private workloads, VPC communication, and deep network-level traffic.

✅ **Defense-in-depth** = Protect all OSI layers, not just the application.
