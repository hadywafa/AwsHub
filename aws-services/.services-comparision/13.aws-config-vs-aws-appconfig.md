# **AWS Config** vs **AWS AppConfig**

> **AWS Config** and **AWS AppConfig** are two completely different AWS services with very different purposes. Here's a clear comparison:

---

## 🔍 **1. AWS Config** – _Compliance & Change Tracking_

### 📌 **Purpose:**

AWS Config is a **governance and compliance tool** used to **track and audit resource configurations** in your AWS environment.

### ✅ **Main Use Cases:**

- Monitor configuration changes to AWS resources (e.g., EC2, S3, IAM, etc.)
- Detect and alert on compliance violations
- Track historical resource configuration (who changed what and when)
- Use rules to enforce best practices or security policies

### 📦 **Example:**

You want to ensure **S3 buckets are never public**.
✅ You use an AWS Config rule like `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`.

### 🛠️ How It Works

- Continuously records resource configurations
- Evaluates against rules (managed or custom)
- Stores findings in **Config history and snapshots**

---

## 🧩 **2. AWS AppConfig** – _Runtime Configuration Management_

### 📌 **Purpose:**

AWS AppConfig (part of AWS Systems Manager) lets you **manage, validate, and deploy runtime configuration** to applications **without redeploying the code**.

### ✅ **Main Use Cases:**

- Feature flags / toggles (e.g., turn a feature ON/OFF in real-time)
- Roll out new settings gradually (e.g., canary deployments)
- Decouple app logic from environment configuration
- Avoid risky deploys by validating configurations before rollout

### 📦 **Example:**

You want to **enable dark mode UI for 10% of users**.
✅ Store the feature toggle in AppConfig and roll it out gradually.

### 🛠️ How It Works

- Configuration is stored as JSON, YAML, or plaintext
- Validated against schemas
- Deployed using controlled rollout (linear, exponential, canary)
- Apps retrieve config via **SDK or HTTP polling**

| Feature                     | AWS Config                          | AWS AppConfig                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 🔧 **Primary Use**          | Audit, compliance, change tracking  | Dynamic app configuration at runtime        |
| 📊 **Targets**              | AWS resources                       | Application settings (feature flags, envs)  |
| 📚 **Data Types**           | Resource metadata                   | JSON, YAML, plaintext config data           |
| 📈 **History Tracking**     | Yes, full change history            | No (config versioning only)                 |
| 🧪 **Validation**           | Compliance rules                    | Schema & Lambda-based validators            |
| 🚀 **Deployment Model**     | Passive monitoring                  | Controlled rollout with deployment strategy |
| 🔄 **Rollbacks / Strategy** | No                                  | Built-in rollback on config errors          |
| 🔐 **Security Use Case**    | Enforce non-public S3, MFA, tagging | Toggle risky features without redeploying   |

### ✅ Use **AWS Config** if

- You want to **audit and monitor** infrastructure compliance
- You care about **security rules**, **resource drift**, or **configuration history**

### ✅ Use **AWS AppConfig** if

- You need to **control app behavior** via settings or feature toggles
- You want **zero-downtime rollout** of configuration changes
