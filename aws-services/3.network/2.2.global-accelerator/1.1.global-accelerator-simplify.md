## 🚀 What Is AWS Global Accelerator?

**AWS Global Accelerator** is a **network traffic accelerator** that uses AWS’s **global infrastructure** to improve **latency, availability, and failover** for your apps — regardless of where users are on the planet.

✅ You get **2 static Anycast IPs** that direct traffic to the **closest healthy AWS region** running your application.

## 🧠 Why Global Accelerator?

</div>

Without it:

- Global users connect over the **public internet**
- Many **slow, unpredictable hops**
- Higher **latency and failure risk**

With it:

- Users connect to the **nearest AWS edge location**
- Routed through the **AWS global backbone**
- **Fewer hops**, faster response, and built-in **failover**

## 🆚 Anycast vs. Unicast IPs

## 🧱 Core Components

### 1️⃣ **Anycast IPs**

- You get **2 static IPs** (IPv4) or 4 for dual-stack (IPv4+IPv6)
- Clients connect via these fixed IPs (can whitelist them!)
- **No DNS caching issues**, since IPs never change

### 2️⃣ **AWS Edge Locations**

- Over 100 edge locations worldwide
- Serve as **entry points to the AWS network**
- Traffic is routed from edge to app **inside AWS**

### 3️⃣ **Global Health Checks**

- Global Accelerator checks each endpoint's health
- If a region fails, traffic is **instantly rerouted (< 60 sec)**

## 🛠️ Supported Origin Types

Global Accelerator supports both **public** and **private** resources:

| ✅ Resource Type     | Examples                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **ALB / NLB**        | For web apps or load balancers |
| **EC2 Instance**     | Direct compute instance access |
| **Elastic IP (EIP)** | IP-attached workloads          |

    participant User as 🌎 Global User
    participant GA as 🌐 Global Accelerator (Static IP)
    participant Edge as 🛰️ AWS Edge Location
    participant App as 🖥️ ALB or EC2 in Region

    User->>GA: Access App via Static IP
    GA->>Edge: Route to nearest Edge
    Edge->>App: Forward to healthy endpoint
    App-->>User: Respond via AWS Network

## 🛠️ Quick Setup (Console)

1. **Open AWS Global Accelerator Console**
2. Click **Create Accelerator**
3. Define:

   - Accelerator name
   - IPv4 / dual-stack
   - Listener port + protocol (TCP/UDP)

4. Create **endpoint group** (region)
5. Add **endpoint** (ALB, EC2, etc.)
6. Enable **health checks**
7. Done! 🎉 Two static IPs are generated.

| 🔥 Concept                   | 📌 Note                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Anycast IPs                  | Global IPs routed to nearest edge                 |
| BYOIP                        | You can bring your own static IP                  |
| Health Checks                | Enabled by default for regional failover          |
| Works with private resources | ✅ ALB/EC2 in **private subnet** (not exposed)    |
| vs CloudFront                | CloudFront = CDN; GA = full network accelerator   |
| Use with UDP                 | Yes (CloudFront only supports HTTP/HTTPS)         |
| Static IP whitelisting       | Simplifies access from external firewalls/devices |
