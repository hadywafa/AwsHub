# üîë **API Gateway ‚Äì Usage Plans & API Keys**

> Use **Usage Plans** and **API Keys** in API Gateway when you want to **control, throttle, and monetize** access to your API.

Perfect for offering your API as a **service to external developers or customers**.

---

## üß≠ What Is a Usage Plan?

A **Usage Plan** defines:

- ‚úÖ **Which API stages/methods** a client can access
- ‚úÖ **How much traffic** they can send (quotas)
- ‚úÖ **How fast** they can send it (throttling)
- ‚úÖ It uses **API keys** to identify and limit each user

---

## üîë What Is an API Key?

An **API Key** is just an **alphanumeric string** given to customers to:

- Identify the client calling your API
- Enforce rate limits and quotas

üì¶ Example Key:

```ini
WBjHxNtoAb4WPKBC7cGm64CBibIb24b4jt8jJHo9
```

Clients must include the key in their request headers:

```http
x-api-key: WBjHxNtoAb4WPKBC7cGm64CBibIb24b4jt8jJHo9
```

## üö¶ Rate Limiting in Usage Plans

| Feature           | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Throttle Rate** | Max requests per second (e.g., 10 rps)    |

| **Quota Limit**   | Total requests allowed per day/week/month |

## üß± Correct Setup Order (Step-by-Step)

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Create & deploy your API**

- Set methods (e.g., `GET /data`) to **require an API key**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create or import API keys**

- You generate keys for each customer

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Create a Usage Plan**

- Define throttling and quota rules

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Attach**

- Associate the API stages and API keys to the usage plan

‚úÖ Now your API is protected and rate-limited per client

## üîí Request Example

```http
GET https://api.example.com/v1/data
x-api-key: WBjHxNtoAb4WPKBC7cGm64CBibIb24b4jt8jJHo9
