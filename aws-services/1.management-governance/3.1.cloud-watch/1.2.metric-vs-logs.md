# 📊 **Metrics vs 📝 Logs – Simple Explanation**

| Feature             | 📊 **Metrics**                       | 📝 **Logs**                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **What is it?**     | A **number** that measures something | A **detailed message** describing what happened     |
| **Format**          | Numeric (e.g., `CPU = 87%`)          | Textual (e.g., `"ERROR: Timeout on order #45"`)     |
| **How is it used?** | For charts, dashboards, alarms       | For debugging, tracking events, root cause analysis |
| **Granularity**     | High-level summary                   | Low-level, line-by-line events                      |
| **Examples**        | CPU usage, error rate, latency       | Full stack trace, print statements, exceptions      |
| **Stored in**       | CloudWatch **Metrics**               | CloudWatch **Logs**                                 |
| **Size**            | Lightweight                          | Heavyweight (can grow large fast)                   |

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy

- **Metrics** = Like your **fitness tracker**

  - Tells you: heart rate = 95 bpm, steps = 10,000

- **Logs** = Like your **personal journal**

  - Tells you: “Went for a run today. Felt tired. Weather was cold.”

---

## 🛠️ Example: Lambda Function

Let’s say your Lambda function **fails due to a timeout**.

### 📊 Metrics

- Shows: `5XX Error count = 3`
- Shows: `Duration = 28,000 ms`

### 📝 Logs

- Shows:

  ```ini
  START RequestId: abc123
  Processing payment...
  ERROR: Timeout connecting to Stripe
  END RequestId: abc123
  ```

So:

- Metrics **tell you** something went wrong
- Logs **show you exactly what** and **why**

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

> ✅ **Use metrics to detect issues**
> ✅ **Use logs to investigate and fix them**

They work **together**:

- CloudWatch Alarm (metric) triggers an alert
- You open CloudWatch Logs to **see the details**
