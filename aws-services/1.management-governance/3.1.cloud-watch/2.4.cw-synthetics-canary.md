## 🚀 What Is a Synthetics Canary?

A **Canary** is a **scripted, automated browser test** that **simulates user interactions** with your application or API.

✅ It runs on a schedule, **just like a real user**, and helps detect:

- Broken links
- API failures
- Page load delays
- Visual issues

> Named after the **“canary in a coal mine”** 🐤 — it warns you _before_ users are impacted.

---

## 🧩 Real-World Example

> You build an ecommerce app. Create 3 canaries:

1. `HomepageCanary` – loads homepage every 1 min
2. `LoginCanary` – logs in with test credentials every 5 min
3. `CheckoutAPI` – checks response from `/api/checkout`

🎯 If login breaks or checkout fails, you’ll know **before your customers** do.

---

## ⚙️ Integration with CloudWatch

✅ Each canary automatically creates:

| Resource               | Use                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **CloudWatch Metrics** | For success %, duration, failures              |
| **CloudWatch Logs**    | Stores logs, results, failures, screenshots    |
| **Alarms**             | Optional alarms on failure rate, latency, etc. |
| **S3 Bucket**          | Stores screenshots and HAR files               |

---

## 🛠️ Scripting Canaries

- Written in **Node.js** or **Python**
- Use the [Synthetics API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library.html)
- Script is run by AWS Lambda in the background
- Headless Chrome browser is included

### 🧠 Example

```javascript
const synthetics = require("Synthetics");
const log = require("SyntheticsLogger");

exports.handler = async function () {
  const page = await synthetics.getPage();
  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  log.info("Loaded the homepage");
  await page.screenshot({ path: "/tmp/example.png" });
};
```
