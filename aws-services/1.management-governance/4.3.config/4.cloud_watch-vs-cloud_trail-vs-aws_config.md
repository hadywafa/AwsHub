## 🚦 Quick Summary

| Feature    | 🧠 CloudWatch                   | 🕵️‍♂️ CloudTrail                        | ✅ AWS Config                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Purpose    | Performance monitoring          | API call auditing                    | Configuration history & compliance    |
| Tracks     | Metrics, logs, alarms           | Who did what (API actions)           | How resources change over time        |
| Real-Time? | ✅ Near real-time               | ❌ \~15 min delay                    | ❌ Not real-time, event-based         |
| Visibility | System metrics + custom metrics | Account-level activity               | Resource-level state and history      |
| Alerts     | ✅ Alarms & EventBridge         | ✅ EventBridge via trail integration | ✅ EventBridge & remediation triggers |
| Storage    | CloudWatch Logs                 | S3 Buckets (log files)               | Config Snapshots stored in Config/S3  |

## 🧪 Unified Example: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

Let’s say you have an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**. Here’s how each service would help:

---

### 📊 **CloudWatch – Real-Time Monitoring & Alarms**

- Monitors performance metrics like:

  - **IncomingConnections**
  - **HTTP 4xx/5xx errors**
  - **TargetResponseTime**

- Use dashboards to track global health of multiple ALBs
- Trigger alarms when thresholds are crossed

**Example**:
🚨 Alert if `HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count > 50` in 5 minutes

---

### 🔐 **AWS Config – Configuration Tracking & Compliance**

- Detects **security group rule changes**
- Tracks changes to listener ports, SSL certs, target groups
- Evaluate **compliance rules** like:

  - “ALBs must always use HTTPS”
  - “ALBs must be associated with WAF”

**Example Rules**:

```yaml
- EnsureLoadBalancerHasSSLCert
- DisallowLoadBalancerHTTPListeners
```

**Use case**:
🔎 _"Was an insecure listener added to this ALB?"_
✅ Config shows _when_, _what changed_, and _if it violated compliance_.

---

### 🧾 **CloudTrail – API Call Logging & User Actions**

- Logs API calls like:

  - `ModifyLoadBalancerAttributes`
  - `DeleteListener`
  - `AttachTargetGroup`

- Answers:

  - ❓ _Who added this security group?_
  - ❓ _Which user disabled logging on this ALB?_

**Example**:
🧑‍💻 _DevOpsUser123 used `DeleteLoadBalancer` at `12:05 UTC`_

## 🧠 Mental Model

| Question                            | Use...                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| “How is my app performing?”         | **CloudWatch**                        |
| “Who changed this setting?”         | **CloudTrail**                        |
| “What did this resource look like?” | **AWS Config**                        |
| “Is this resource compliant?”       | **AWS Config**                        |
| “Alert me if something breaks”      | **CloudWatch**                        |
| “Trigger an auto-remediation”       | **AWS Config** (SSM), **EventBridge** |

## 💡 Pro Tip for the Exam

AWS loves **complementary use** of these three:

- 🔁 **CloudTrail** tracks _who made changes_
- 📜 **Config** records _what changed and when_
- 📈 **CloudWatch** tells _how the system is performing_
