## 🧠 **What is AWS Service Catalog?**

**AWS Service Catalog** helps organizations manage and distribute IT services. Think of it like a menu at a restaurant, but instead of food, it's a list of approved IT resources and services you can use. Here’s a breakdown:

- 📋 **Catalog of approved products** (infrastructure, software, databases)
- 🛡️ **Enforced governance and compliance** at deployment
- 🚀 **Self-service** portal for end-users like developers, without losing security controls

> 💡 Think of it as a **secure AWS Marketplace customized for your organization**.

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Internal use only (your approved catalog) | Public marketplace with AWS-vetted software |
| Admin-curated templates (CloudFormation)  | Vendor-built SaaS, AMIs, etc.               |
| Full control over what’s published        | Limited to vendor-provided products         |

✅ **Use Service Catalog** when you want **internal control** and **pre-approval**.
