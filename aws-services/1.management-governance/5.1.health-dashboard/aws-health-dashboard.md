## 📬 **Health Event Notifications – Stay Proactively Informed**

The **AWS Health Dashboard** doesn't just visualize incidents—it can also **trigger real-time actions**.

By integrating **AWS Health Events** with **Amazon EventBridge**, you can **automate alerts and remediation** when AWS detects issues affecting your resources.

---

### 💡 **Common Use Cases**

- 📩 Send email/slack alert if **an EC2 instance is scheduled for maintenance**
- 🔐 Automatically **disable a route** if a **VPN or Direct Connect issue** is reported
- 📊 Forward events to **SIEM/Splunk** for incident analysis
- 🧑‍🔧 Notify **DevOps teams** when **regional outages** affect services they manage

---

### 🧪 **Example: Email When EC2 Is Scheduled for Maintenance**

Let’s walk through an example setup:

**Goal**: Receive an email when EC2 health events affect your account.

</div>

#### 🛠️ Step-by-Step (EventBridge + SNS)

1. **Open EventBridge Console**
2. Create a new **Rule**

   - _Event Source_: AWS Health

       "detail-type": ["AWS Health Event"],
       "detail": {
         "service": ["EC2"],
         "eventTypeCategory": ["scheduledChange"]
       }
     }
     ```

3. Set **target** to an SNS Topic (email)
