## 🌟 **What is AWS CloudHSM?**

**AWS CloudHSM** is a **fully managed hardware security module (HSM)** service that enables you to:

- 🔑 **Safeguard cryptographic keys** with dedicated HSM devices.
- 🔒 **Perform encryption, decryption, digital signing, and key management** securely.
- 🤝 **Retain full control** over your cryptographic operations — AWS does not have access.

✅ Ideal for use cases demanding **the highest levels of security and compliance** (e.g., financial services, healthcare, government).
