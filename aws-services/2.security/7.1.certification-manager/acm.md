## 🌟 **What is AWS Certificate Manager?**

**AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** is a **fully managed service** that:

- 📜 **Issues**, **manages**, **renews**, and **deploys** SSL/TLS certificates.
- 🔒 Helps secure websites, APIs, and internal applications with **encryption** and **identity authentication**.
- 🚀 Eliminates manual steps like CSR generation, private key handling, and renewals.

✅ **You focus on securing your app, not managing certificates manually!**

## 🔑 **Key Capabilities of ACM**

| Capability                                     | What It Does                                                             |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📥 **Certificate Issuance**                    | Instantly issue **public** or **private** certificates for your domains. |
| 🔁 **Automatic Renewal**                       | ACM automatically renews its issued certificates — no downtime!          |
| 🛠️ **Certificate Import**                      | Import your existing third-party certificates if needed.                 |
| 🌐 **Wildcard Certificates**                   | Secure entire subdomains (e.g., `*.example.com`).                        |
| 🏛️ **Private Certificate Authority (ACM PCA)** | Manage internal certificates for private networks or devices.            |

✅ Simplified **public web app** and **internal enterprise security** management.

## 📜 **Types of Certificates in ACM**

| Certificate Type             | Description                                                                   |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌐 **Public Certificates**   | Free ACM-issued certs trusted by browsers (for internet-facing apps).         |
| 🏛️ **Private Certificates**  | Issued using **ACM Private CA** for internal apps (e.g., microservices, IoT). |
| ✳️ **Wildcard Certificates** | Secures all subdomains (`*.example.com`) with one cert.                       |
| 📥 **Imported Certificates** | Bring your own third-party certificates (for rare external needs).            |

## 🧠 **Step-by-Step: Using ACM in Real Life**

### 🚀 Step 1: Request a Certificate

- Open ACM Console ➔ **Request Certificate**.
- Choose **Public** (for internet apps) or **Private** (for internal apps).
- Enter domain names (`www.example.com`, `*.example.com`).

---

### 🛡️ Step 2: Validate Domain Ownership

- ✅ **DNS Validation** (Preferred) → Add a CNAME record to your DNS host.
- ✅ **Email Validation** (Legacy) → Approve through an email sent to domain registrant/admin.

---

### 🏗️ Step 3: Deploy the Certificate

Attach the issued certificate to:

- 🖥️ **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: For web servers behind ALB/NLB.
- 🌍 **CloudFront**: For global website and app acceleration.
- 🚀 **API Gateway**: For protecting your APIs (REST, WebSocket, GraphQL).
- 🧠 **Cognito User Pools**: For secure authentication endpoints.
- 📦 **Amplify, App Runner, Beanstalk**: For modern apps.
- 🔍 **OpenSearch**: For encrypted search services.

---

### 🔄 Step 4: Automatic Renewal & Monitoring

- ACM auto-renews ACM-issued certificates **90 days before expiration**.
- For **imported certificates**, monitor and re-import manually.

Check certificate status via:

```bash
aws acm list-certificates
```

✅ Stay secure without worrying about expiry dates!

## ✨ **Where ACM Certificates Can Be Used**

| AWS Service                                   | Purpose                                           |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| 🖥️ **Elastic Load Balancer**                  | Encrypt traffic between client and load balancer. |
| 🌍 **CloudFront Distributions**               | HTTPS globally with low latency.                  |
| 🚀 **API Gateway**                            | Secure APIs over HTTPS.                           |
| 🧠 **Cognito**                                | Secure login portals.                             |
| ⚙️ **Elastic Beanstalk, App Runner, Amplify** | Auto-attach certs to web apps.                    |

## ⚠️ **Limitations of AWS Certificate Manager**

| Limitation                                      | Details                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚫 **No Export of Public ACM Certificates**     | You cannot download ACM public certs for local servers (security reasons). |
| 🚫 **No Direct Install on EC2**                 | Use a Load Balancer or CloudFront to present the cert.                     |
| 🔁 **Manual Renewal for Imported Certificates** | Imported certs require your manual monitoring and renewal.                 |

✅ **Plan architecture accordingly** when using ACM!
