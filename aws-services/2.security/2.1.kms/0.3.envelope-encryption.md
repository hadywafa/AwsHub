# 🔄 There are **two uses of asymmetric + symmetric encryption**, but they are **not the same thing**

## 1. 🔐 **TLS (In Transit)** — Client/Server Communication

You're absolutely right here:

> ✅ **Asymmetric encryption is used first to exchange the session key**,
> then that **symmetric session key** is used for fast encryption of the actual data.

### 🔁 Steps in TLS

1. Client gets server's **public key**
2. Client encrypts a **pre-master key** with it
3. Server decrypts it with its **private key**
4. Both sides generate the same **symmetric session key**
5. All communication is encrypted using that **symmetric key**

🧠 **This is not envelope encryption.**
It's a **key exchange mechanism** using asymmetric encryption to establish a secure symmetric key for the session.

## 2. 📦 **Envelope Encryption (At Rest)** — Data Storage

This is different and used mostly in **cloud storage systems (e.g., S3, RDS, etc.)**.

> ✅ Data is encrypted using a **data encryption key (DEK)** (symmetric)
> ✅ The DEK is then encrypted using a **master key (CMK)** stored in KMS (asymmetric or symmetric)

### 🔁 Steps in Envelope Encryption

1. AWS KMS creates a **symmetric DEK** (used to encrypt your data)
2. This DEK is encrypted using a **CMK** (which could be managed by KMS or HSM)
3. You store:

   - **Encrypted data**
   - **Encrypted DEK**

4. When reading:

   - AWS decrypts the DEK using the CMK
   - The DEK decrypts the data

## 📌 So in simple terms

| Context               | Asymmetric Used First?                         | What It’s Called?      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **TLS (Transit)**     | ✅ Yes – to exchange symmetric key             | 🔄 Key Exchange        |
| **Storage (At Rest)** | ❌ No – symmetric key used first, then wrapped | 📦 Envelope Encryption |
