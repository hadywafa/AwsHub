# 🛡️ **IAM PassRole – Granting Permission to Pass IAM Roles to AWS Services**

## 🔎 **What is PassRole?**

The `iam:PassRole` permission allows a user, group, or role to **assign an IAM role to an AWS service** during resource creation or configuration.

> ❗ **PassRole ≠ AssumeRole** > `PassRole` lets a user **assign a role** to a service.
> `AssumeRole` lets a user/service **use a role’s permissions**.

## 📘 **Use Cases**

| ✅ **Service**     | 🧭 **Scenario**                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **EC2**            | Launch an instance with an IAM role attached                       |
| **Lambda**         | Assign an execution role to a Lambda function                      |
| **ECS**            | Assign a task role to an ECS task definition                       |
| **CodePipeline**   | Use a role to allow a pipeline to invoke Lambda, deploy apps, etc. |
| **CloudFormation** | Create a stack that provisions resources using a specific role     |

## 🛠️ **How to Grant PassRole Permissions**

You must define **two things**:

1. **Permissions policy** (identity policy) → Allows `iam:PassRole`
2. **Trust policy** (on the role) → Allows the AWS service to assume it

---

### 🔐 **1. Permissions Policy Example (attached to user or role)**

This lets an IAM user pass the role to an AWS service:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iam:PassRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "ec2:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

✅ This IAM policy allows:

- Full EC2 access
- Passing the `S3Access` role to EC2 (e.g., when launching an instance)

---

### 🧾 **2. Trust Policy Example (on the Role to be Passed)**

This role defines **who is allowed to assume it**. In this case, only **EC2** can use it.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
    },
    "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  }
}
```

> 🔒 If the service is not listed in the **trust policy**, it cannot assume the role even if `iam:PassRole` is allowed.

---

## ✅ **Complete Workflow Example: Assigning a Role to EC2**

### 1️⃣ User has this permissio

```json
{
  "Action": "iam:PassRole",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyEC2Role"
}
```

### 2️⃣ EC2 role has this trust

```json
{
  "Principal": {
    "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
  },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
}
```

### 3️⃣ Now, user launches EC2 and attaches `MyEC2Role` → ✅ Success

---

## ⚠️ **Can You Pass a Role to Any Service?**

**No.** Even if `iam:PassRole` allows it, **the role's trust policy must explicitly allow the target service**.

> Example: A role that trusts `lambda.amazonaws.com` **cannot** be used with EC2.

---

## 🔐 **Best Practices**

- ✅ Always **limit the roles** users can pass (`Resource` scoping).
- 🚫 Never use `"Resource": "*"` unless absolutely necessary.
- 🕵️ Use **CloudTrail** to monitor for `iam:PassRole` and `sts:AssumeRole` events.
- 🔐 Separate **creation permissions** from **execution permissions** (least privilege).
- 🧪 Use `iam:GetRole` in combo with `iam:PassRole` to validate roles during automation.

## 🧠 Summary Table

| **Concept**      | **Description**                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `iam:PassRole`   | Grants permission to assign a role to a service        |
| `sts:AssumeRole` | Grants permission to **use** the permissions of a role |
| Identity Policy  | Defines who can **pass** the role                      |
| Trust Policy     | Defines which **service** can **assume** the role      |
| Role Restriction | Must match in both `PassRole` + Trust                  |
| Common Services  | EC2, Lambda, ECS, CodePipeline, CloudFormation         |
