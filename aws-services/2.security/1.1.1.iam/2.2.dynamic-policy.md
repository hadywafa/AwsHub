# 🔄 **Dynamic Policies with IAM – Scalable Access Control**

Managing access at scale—especially when assigning users their own folders or resources—can quickly become unmanageable if you create one policy per user. Instead, AWS IAM supports **dynamic policy variables** that let you write **one policy for many users**.

---

## 🎯 **Problem: One Policy Per User Doesn’t Scale**

Imagine you're building a system where each IAM user should only have access to their personal folder under an S3 bucket like:

```ini
s3://my-company/home/georges/
s3://my-company/home/sarah/
s3://my-company/home/matt/
```

### ❌ **Naive Approach: One Policy Per User**

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-company/home/georges/*"
}
```

You’d need a **separate policy** for each user like Sarah, Matt, etc. This quickly becomes hard to manage.

---

## ✅ **Solution: Use Dynamic IAM Policy Variables**

Instead of hardcoding user names, **IAM supports policy variables** like `${aws:username}`.

---

### 🔐 **Dynamic Policy Example**

```json
{
  "Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["s3:*"],
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-company/home/${aws:username}/*"]
}
```

### 🧠 **How It Works:**

- `${aws:username}` is automatically **replaced at runtime** with the actual IAM username of the caller.
- This allows you to **reuse the same policy for multiple users**, while **scoping access to their personal folder** only.

## 🔍 **Supported Dynamic Variables in IAM**

| Variable                  | Description                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `${aws:username}`         | Name of the IAM user making the request |
| `${aws:userid}`           | Unique ID of the IAM user               |
| `${aws:principalTag/...}` | Tag on the user or role                 |
| `${aws:requester}`        | ARN of the principal making the request |
| `${aws:CurrentTime}`      | Time the request was made               |

➡️ You can even combine variables in bucket policies for complex access patterns.

## 🧪 **Real Use Case: User Home Directory Access in S3**

You want each IAM user to only access:

```ini
s3://my-company/home/<their-username>/
```

With the dynamic policy:

- IAM user `georges` will be allowed `s3:*` on `s3://my-company/home/georges/*`
- IAM user `sarah` will be allowed `s3:*` on `s3://my-company/home/sarah/*`

All using the **same policy definition**!

## ⚠️ Best Practices

- Use dynamic variables **only with trusted identities** (e.g., IAM Users, not anonymous roles).
- Always combine with **least privilege** principle.
- Validate dynamic expressions in your policy simulator before deploying.
