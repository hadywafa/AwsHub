## 🌟 **What is AWS Firewall Manager?**

**AWS Firewall Manager** is a **security management service** that helps you:

- 🛡️ Centrally configure and enforce firewall rules across **multiple AWS accounts and resources**.
- 🚀 Automatically apply security policies **as new resources are created**.
- 🔄 Ensure consistent security posture across **your entire AWS Organization**.

✅ One place to manage:

- **AWS WAF rules**
- **AWS Shield Advanced protections**
- **VPC security groups**
- **AWS Network Firewall rules**
- **Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rules**

---

## 🧠 **Why AWS Firewall Manager Matters**

Without Firewall Manager:

- Every AWS account team might configure security differently (risky!).
- Hard to ensure all accounts apply updated WAF rules or Shield protections.
- New resources (e.g., ALB, API Gateway) might launch **unprotected** by mistake.

✅ Firewall Manager **automates** applying security policies **uniformly and immediately**.

## 🛡️ **Example: WAF + Shield Protection Auto-Applied**

| Without Firewall Manager                                                         | With Firewall Manager                                                               |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admins must manually apply WAF Web ACLs to every new CloudFront or ALB resource. | New CloudFront or ALB distributions automatically get the right WAF rules attached. |
| Shield Advanced must be manually subscribed per resource.                        | Shield Advanced is automatically enabled when a resource is created.                |
| Risk of human error and security gaps.                                           | Security posture is **automatic, uniform, and fast**.                               |
