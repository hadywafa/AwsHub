# üîê **What is an IAM Identity Provider in AWS?**

> _Use an identity provider (Idp) to manage your user identities outside of AWS, but grant the user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account._

## üìå **Official Definition**

> "An IAM identity provider is an entity that describes an identity provider (IdP) service ‚Äî such as Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or another SAML-compliant provider ‚Äî that you can use to **authenticate users who want to assume IAM roles**."

---

### üß† **What This Means Practically:**

You set up an **IAM identity provider** to enable **federated access** from an **external IdP** (like Okta, Azure AD, or Google) using protocols like:

- **SAML 2.0**
- **OIDC (OpenID Connect)**

Once configured, users from your external IdP can **assume IAM roles**, meaning they **temporarily get AWS permissions** without having an IAM user.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **How it Works (Simplified Flow):**

<div style="text-align: center;">

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant IdP as IdP (e.g., Okta)
  participant AWS IAM

  User->>IdP: Login with corporate credentials
  IdP-->>User: SAML assertion
  User->>AWS IAM: AssumeRoleWithSAML
  AWS IAM-->>User: Temporary credentials (via STS)
  User->>AWS Services: Use credentials
```

</div>

---

### ‚úÖ Use Case Example

You want your company employees to use **Okta login** to access AWS Console **without creating IAM users**. You configure a SAML Identity Provider in IAM, create a role, and map Okta groups to it.

## üßë‚Äçüíº **Then What is IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)?**

IAM Identity Center is the **next-generation identity federation solution** in AWS.

### ‚ûï **It adds:**

- Central user and group management (via built-in directory or external IdP)
- Graphical UI for managing permissions across **multiple AWS accounts**
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)** to AWS Console & CLI
- Integration with **SAML 2.0 IdPs** and **SCIM provisioning**

---

### üõ†Ô∏è How IAM Identity Center Works (Simplified Flow)

<div style="text-align: center;">

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Identity Center
  participant IdP as IdP (e.g., Azure AD)
  participant AWS Accounts

  User->>Identity Center: Click Login
  Identity Center->>IdP: Redirect for authentication
  IdP-->>Identity Center: Auth success
  Identity Center-->>User: Show assigned roles/apps
  User->>AWS Accounts: SSO access with assigned permissions
```

</div>

## üÜö IAM Identity Provider vs IAM Identity Center

| Feature                        | **IAM Identity Provider** | **IAM Identity Center** (Recommended)  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Protocols                      | SAML / OIDC               | SAML (auth), SCIM (provisioning)       |
| UI for User Management         | ‚ùå No                     | ‚úÖ Yes                                 |
| Centralized Access Across Orgs | ‚ùå No                     | ‚úÖ Yes (AWS Organizations integration) |
| Built-in Directory             | ‚ùå No                     | ‚úÖ Yes (or connect to external)        |
| Temporary Role Assumption Only | ‚úÖ Yes                    | ‚úÖ But managed automatically           |
| Modern AWS Recommendation      | ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy / Low-level use | ‚úÖ Preferred for enterprises           |

## üí° Why AWS Recommends IAM Identity Center?

AWS is moving toward **simplified identity and access management** across multiple accounts with fewer moving parts.

‚úÖ IAM Identity Center:

- Supports **multi-account access** using fine-grained permission sets
- Works with **external IdPs** like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace
- Offers built-in **audit, logging**, and **UI for access control**
- Works well with **CLI access (via `aws sso login`)**
- Future-proof and supported by most AWS services

## üß≠ **TL;DR Quick Summary**

| Concept                   | What it Does                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **IAM Identity Provider** | Lets you **federate users** from an external IdP (like SAML or OIDC) to assume IAM roles in AWS.                                                             |
| **IAM Identity Center**   | Modern **SSO solution** to centrally manage access across **multiple AWS accounts** and apps, with a **UI**, **directory**, and **integrated provisioning**. |

> ‚úÖ **Use IAM Identity Center** unless you have a specific legacy or low-level use case that needs direct role assumption via SAML or OIDC federation.

---

## üèÅ Final Recommendation

Use **IAM Identity Center** if:

- You have more than one AWS account
- You need SSO and role-based access control
- You want to avoid managing low-level IAM configurations

Use **IAM Identity Provider** only if:

- You have a **specific custom federated login** use case
- You need fine-grained control at the protocol level (SAML/OIDC)
- You are integrating directly with STS or building custom federation flows
