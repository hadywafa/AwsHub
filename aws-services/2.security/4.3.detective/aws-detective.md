## 🌟 **What is AWS Detective?**

**Amazon Detective** is a **fully managed security investigation service** that:

- 🔎 Helps you **analyze and investigate** suspicious activities across AWS accounts.
- 🧠 Uses **machine learning** and **graph analysis** to automatically build visual timelines of events.
- 🚨 Correlates **logs and findings** into easy-to-understand investigation maps.

✅ Instead of manually checking CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty findings separately — Detective **connects everything together visually**.

✅ It’s like your **cloud security detective assistant** 🕵️ —  
mapping out **what happened, when it happened, and how** it’s all connected.
