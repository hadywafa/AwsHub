## 🌟 **What is a Web ACL in AWS WAF?**

A **Web ACL (Web Access Control List)** is the **main building block** in AWS WAF.

✅ It’s a **set of rules** that decides:

- 📥 Which HTTP/S requests to **Allow**
- 🚫 Which requests to **Block**
- 📊 Which requests to simply **Count** (for monitoring)
- 🤖 Whether to **Challenge (CAPTCHA)** or **Verify (Challenge)** users

✅ You **attach** a Web ACL to your AWS resources like:

- **CloudFront distributions**
- **Application Load Balancers (ALB)**
- **API Gateway endpoints**
- **AWS AppSync APIs**
- **Amazon Cognito user pools**

## 🛠️ **How AWS WAF Web ACLs Work**

```mermaid

    A[Incoming HTTP/S Request] --> B[WAF Web ACL]
    B --> C{Match any rule?}
    C -- Yes --> D["Apply matching rule action (Allow, Block, Count, CAPTCHA)"]
    C -- No --> E[Apply Default Action (Allow/Block)]
```

✅ **WAF Web ACL** acts like a **filtering gate** at the very first step before your app handles anything.

## 🔎 **Main Components of a Web ACL**

| Component             | Description                                                         |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧱 **Web ACL**        | The container that holds and orders rules                           |
| 📜 **Rules**          | Conditions that inspect parts of requests (headers, IP, body, etc.) |
| 📚 **Rule Groups**    | Bundles of rules (AWS Managed or your own)                          |
| 🔢 **Priority Order** | Rules are evaluated in order — first match wins                     |
| ⚙️ **Default Action** | What happens if no rules match (Allow or Block)                     |
| 🎯 **Rule Actions**   | Allow, Block, Count, CAPTCHA, Challenge                             |

---

## ✨ **Actions a Rule Can Perform**

| Action           | Purpose                                             |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Allow**     | Let the request through                             |
| 🚫 **Block**     | Reject the request with a 403 Forbidden             |
| 📊 **Count**     | Do not affect the request but log it for monitoring |
| 🤖 **CAPTCHA**   | Present a CAPTCHA challenge before allowing         |
| 🧩 **Challenge** | Advanced browser verification (beyond CAPTCHA)      |

---

## 🪜 **Web ACL Evaluation Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1. Request reaches your resource (CloudFront/ALB/API Gateway).
2. WAF evaluates request **against each rule** in Web ACL in priority order.
3. First matching rule **decides the action** (Allow/Block/Count/Challenge).
4. If no rule matches, **Default Action** (Allow or Block) applies.
5. WAF logs decision (if configured) to **S3**, **CloudWatch Logs**, or **Kinesis Data Firehose**.

## 🎯 **Example: Simple Web ACL Structure**

| Priority | Rule Name              | Condition                                     | Action |
| :------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :----- |
| 1        | BlockBadIPs            | IP set match (blocked IP list)                | Block  |
| 2        | SQLInjectionProtection | SQLi patterns detected in body/query          | Block  |
| 3        | RateLimitAPI           | More than 1000 requests per 5 minutes from IP | Block  |
| 4        | AllowAllOthers         | Default                                       | Allow  |

✅ Requests are evaluated **top to bottom**.

## 📚 **Common Web ACL Rules You Can Create**

| Rule Type                   | Example Use                                                  |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🚫 **IP Set Rules**         | Block specific IP addresses or CIDR ranges                   |
| 🛡️ **AWS Managed Rules**    | Use pre-built rules against common threats like OWASP Top 10 |
| ✍️ **String Match Rules**   | Block requests containing suspicious keywords                |
| 🐛 **SQLi/XSS Match Rules** | Block SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting                 |
| 🌍 **Geo Match Rules**      | Allow or block countries or regions                          |
| 🚀 **Rate-Based Rules**     | Automatically block abusive traffic                          |

| :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| 🔥 **Protect Against OWASP Top 10 Threats** | Use Managed Rule Groups (SQLi, XSS, etc.)  |
| 🚀 **Control API Abuse**                    | Enforce request rate limits                |
| 🌍 **Restrict Geographic Access**           | Allow/block based on user locations        |
| 🤖 **Filter Bots**                          | Apply CAPTCHA or block bad bots            |
| 🛡️ **Custom Business Logic**                | Create your own rules for specific threats |
