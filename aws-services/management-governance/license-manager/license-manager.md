## 🛠️ **How to Use AWS License Manager (Step-by-Step)**

### ✅ 1. **Create License Configuration**

- Go to **AWS Console → AWS License Manager**
- Click **“Create license configuration”**
- Define:
  - License type (Standard, Windows, SQL, SAP, Oracle)
  - Metrics (instances, vCPUs, cores, sockets)
  - Limits (e.g., Max 20 licenses)

### ✅ 2. **Associate Configuration with Resources**

- Associate the configuration with:
  - AMIs (EC2 Images)
  - Launch Templates
  - Instances
  - Systems Manager managed instances (on-prem)

### ✅ 3. **Track and Enforce**

## 🔥 **Real-World Example**

> Let's say you have a **Windows Server Standard BYOL** license for **20 instances** maximum.

- You create a license configuration in AWS License Manager specifying:

  - Product: Windows Server
  - Metric: Instance
  - Hard limit: 20 instances

- If your team tries to launch a 21st instance, AWS can:
  - **Block** the launch automatically
  - **Notify** you about non-compliance
  - **Generate a compliance report**

✅ Now you can scale safely without risking a software audit or huge license penalties.
