# 💸 Amazon Bedrock – Pricing Overview

Amazon Bedrock offers **flexible pricing** options to suit different workload types and budgets. Let’s break it down:

---

## 📦 1. On-Demand Pricing

> **Pay-as-you-go** model, perfect for dynamic or experimental workloads.

| Model Type      | Billing Metric                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Text Models  | Charged per **input/output token** |
| 🧮 Embedding    | Charged per **input token**        |
| 🖼️ Image Models | Charged per **image generated**    |

🔹 **No commitment**  
🔹 **Works with Base Models only**

---

## 🗃️ 2. Batch Inference

> Run **bulk predictions** and output results to Amazon S3.

- Ideal for high-volume use cases
- **Up to 50% cost savings** vs. on-demand
- Single file output format
- **Efficient for scheduled jobs**

## 📊 3. Provisioned Throughput

> Reserve model units for guaranteed performance.

| Feature       | Details                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 💡 Use Case   | Predictable or high-throughput workloads |
| 📆 Billing    | Monthly or 6-month commitment            |
| 🔁 Supports   | Base, Fine-tuned, and Custom Models      |
| 🚀 Throughput | Max tokens processed per minute          |

## 📈 Cost Order of Model Optimization Techniques

| Optimization Method              | Extra Cost? | Notes                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Prompt Engineering            | ❌ No       | Cheapest – no model modification       |
| 2️⃣ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented)     | ❌ No       | External data enhances FM at no cost   |
| 3️⃣ Instruction-based Fine-tuning | ✅ Yes      | Extra compute for specialized behavior |
| 4️⃣ Domain Adaptation Fine-tuning | ✅✅ Yes    | Most expensive – intensive training    |

## 💡 Cost Tips

- 🔄 **On-Demand**: Great for unpredictable or short-term needs
- 📥 **Batch**: Big savings for large jobs
- 🛒 **Provisioned Throughput**: Ideal for consistent high-volume use
- ❄️ **Temperature, Top-K, Top-P**: Have _no impact_ on pricing
- 📏 **Model Size**: Smaller models are usually cheaper
- 🔢 **Token Count**: Main cost driver — fewer tokens = lower cost
