## 📂 **Persistent Storage (1GB)**

CloudShell provides a **1 GB persistent home directory** per region:

- Accessible at `~/`
- Files here remain available across sessions
- Use it to store scripts, configs, temp outputs, etc.

```bash
cd ~
nano my-script.sh
aws s3 ls
```

> ⚠️ Anything stored outside `~/` is ephemeral and lost when session ends.

---

## 🛠️ **Popular Pre-installed Tools**

- `aws` (AWS CLI v2)
- `python3`, `pip`
- `node`, `npm`
- `git`
- `bash`, `zsh`, `PowerShell`
- `kubectl`, `docker` (some regions)

> You can install your own binaries too (but only persist them in `~/`).

---

## 🌍 **How to Access AWS CloudShell**

1. Go to the **AWS Management Console**
2. Click the **CloudShell icon** (top-right of the console)
3. A new terminal tab opens with AWS CLI access
4. Start working!

---

## 🔐 **IAM & Security**

- CloudShell **uses your console identity/role**
- Follows the **same permissions** as your IAM policy
- For example, if your IAM user cannot `s3:ListBucket`, neither can your CloudShell session

✅ No need to manage long-term access keys or set up AWS profiles

# Deploy a Lambda
aws lambda create-function --function-name my-fn ...
