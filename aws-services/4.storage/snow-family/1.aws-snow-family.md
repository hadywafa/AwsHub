## 🛠️ **Recommended Alternatives**

### ☁️ AWS DataSync (for most migrations)

- **Use case**: Daily or incremental syncs from on-prem → S3, EFS, FSx
- **Advantages**: Network-based, agent-driven, no hardware shipping

### ⚙️ AWS Outposts (for persistent edge compute)

- For full AWS infrastructure in on-prem locations

---

## 🔒 **Security & Reliability**

- End-to-end encryption using **AWS KMS**
- **Tamper-resistant** enclosure + secure erasure after transfer
- Built to survive **harsh environments**, physical shocks, and temperature variations

## 💰 **Pricing Considerations**

| Component          | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 📆 Rental Duration | Per-day or per-job pricing                                   |
| 🚚 Shipping        | Round-trip shipping included in many regions                 |
| 💻 Compute Charges | Additional charges if EC2 instances are used                 |
| 📤 Data Upload     | Standard S3 upload charges apply                             |
| 📉 Tiered Pricing  | 1-Year / 3-Year reserved pricing options for cost-efficiency |

## 📈 **Planning Transfer Capacity**

| Link Speed | Transfer per Day | Suitable For               |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| 100 Mbps   | ~1.08 TB/day     | Small workloads            |
| 1 Gbps     | ~10.8 TB/day     | Medium workloads           |
| Snowball   | 210 TB/device    | High-volume, fast transfer |

> 🧠 **Rule of Thumb**:  
> If your network can't finish the job within your timeframe → Go Snow!

## ✅ Final Thoughts

🔹 The **modern AWS Snow Family** is now streamlined: fewer devices, more power, better focus.  
🔹 For **offline petabyte-scale transfers**, **Snowball Edge (Storage Optimized)** is your go-to.  
🔹 For **powerful edge compute**, use the **Compute Optimized** model with EC2, Lambda, and S3 capabilities.  
🔹 For smaller or frequent transfers? Prefer **AWS DataSync**.
