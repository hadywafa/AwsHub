## **💾 3. Volume Gateway**

> The **Volume Gateway** presents block storage volumes to your on-premises apps using the iSCSI protocol.  
> It acts like a local hard disk but the underlying data can be either stored locally or in the cloud, depending on the configuration.

---

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/volume-gateway.png" alt="volume-gateway" style="border-radius: 10px; width: 100%;">
</div>

---

> 📌 It acts like a **virtual external hard drive** connected to your on-premises servers — but with a smart connection to AWS S3 behind the scenes.  
> 📌 It uses the **iSCSI protocol**, so your systems see it like a regular disk (like D:\ or F:\ ).  
> But depending on the mode, the **real data lives either locally or in the cloud**.

---

### **📳 Volume Gateway supports two configurations:**

#### **📌 1. Stored Volumes** — _“Store it here, back it up there”_

- 🗂️ Data is stored **on your local disk**, just like a normal hard drive.
- ☁️ AWS keeps **snapshots (backups)** in S3 for safety.

---

##### **🔑 Key Features:**

- Data is stored locally and accessed with low latency
- Uses iSCSI to expose block volumes to applications
- Takes point-in-time snapshots and stores them in Amazon S3
- Can be deployed on-premises or in EC2 for edge scenarios

##### **🏷️ Ideal When:**

- You need fast access to data locally
- You want to keep using your current storage, but add cloud backup
- You're preparing for disaster recovery or compliance snapshots

#### **📌 2. Cached Volumes** — _“Store it there, keep what’s hot here”_

- ☁️ Data lives **in the cloud (Amazon S3)**.
- 🧠 Only **frequently accessed** files are cached **locally**.

---

##### **🔑 Key Features:**

- Uses **S3 as a block storage** with **virtual volumes in S3**.
- Frequently accessed data is **cached locally on-premises**.
- Exposed as iSCSI volumes to local applications
- Supports snapshots for backups or restore

##### **🏷️ Ideal When:**

- You want to minimize local storage hardware
- You’re slowly migrating to the cloud
- You want scalable block storage but with fast access to hot data

## **🎞️ 4. Tape Gateway**

> **Tape Gateway** provides a cloud-backed virtual tape library (VTL) for backup and archival applications.

---

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 80px;">
    <img src="images/tape-gateway.png" alt="Tape Gateway" style="border-radius: 10px; width: 100%;"/>
</div>

---

### **🔑 Key Features:**

- **Virtual Tape Storage:** Uses Amazon S3 as the primary storage for virtual tapes.
- **Archival Storage:** Archives are stored in Amazon S3 Glacier as Virtual Tape Shelves (VTS) for long-term retention.
- **iSCSI Interface:** Presents an iSCSI interface to your backup servers, mimicking traditional tape libraries.
- **Deployment:** Can be installed on an Amazon EC2 instance to provide a tape gateway within AWS.
- **Security:** Utilizes HTTPS and data compression to securely transfer data to S3.

### **🏃🏻‍♂️‍➡️ Use Cases:**

- **Backup Solutions:** Replace traditional tape-based backup systems with a scalable cloud solution.
- **Archival Storage:** Store long-term archives securely in Amazon S3 Glacier.
