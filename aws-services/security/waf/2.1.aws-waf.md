## 🌟 **What is AWS WAF?**

**AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** is a **managed security service** that:

- 🛡️ Protects **web applications** and **APIs** against common web exploits.
- 🔍 Analyzes **HTTP/S requests** in real-time.
- ⚙️ Applies **customizable rules** to **allow**, **block**, **count**, or **challenge** (CAPTCHA) requests.

✅ Works seamlessly with:

- **Amazon CloudFront**
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **API Gateway**
- **AWS AppSync**
- **Amazon Cognito user pools**

## 🧠 **How AWS WAF Works**

<div align="center" style="padding: 0 20px;">

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Incoming HTTP/S Request] --> B[Evaluated by AWS WAF Web ACL]
    B --> C{Does it match a rule?}
    C -- Block --> D[Return 403 Forbidden or CAPTCHA]
    C -- Allow --> E[Forward Request to Application]
    C -- Count --> F[Log Request for Monitoring]
```

</div>

✅ Requests are **evaluated against Web ACLs** —  
✅ Based on matching rules, they are either **blocked, allowed, counted, or challenged**.

## 🧩 **AWS WAF Web ACLs (Access Control Lists)**

| Component          | Purpose                                            |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web ACL**        | The main container holding all your rules          |
| **Rules**          | Specific conditions to block/allow/count traffic   |
| **Rule Groups**    | Bundles of related rules (yours or AWS Managed)    |
| **Default Action** | Action to take if no rule matches (allow or block) |

✅ You assign Web ACLs to your resources: CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway, etc.
