# 📈 **Detailed AWS WAF + ALB (Elastic Load Balancer) Integration Flow**

- (🌎) Client sends request to ALB DNS
- (🛡️) ALB internally asks WAF Web ACL to evaluate
- (🚦) WAF decides Allow / Block / CAPTCHA
- (🚀) ALB forwards allowed traffic to backend
- (📨) ALB returns the backend response to client

## 🧠 **Quick High-Level Answer**

> ❗ The request **first** reaches the **ALB**.  
> Then **AWS WAF is attached to the ALB itself** and **evaluates the request internally** before forwarding it to your application.

✅ **So WAF does not sit "in front" of ALB** externally.  
✅ **WAF is integrated into the ALB** — working like a filter **inside ALB**.
✅ WAF is **not a separate redirect** — it's **an internal request evaluation step inside ALB**.

## 📋 **Step-by-Step Flow**

1️⃣ Client (browser, API client) sends an HTTP/S request to the ALB DNS name

2️⃣ Request hits the ALB

3️⃣ ALB **invokes AWS WAF evaluation** (attached Web ACL) internally

4️⃣ AWS WAF **applies rules** (Allow, Block, Count, CAPTCHA/Challenge)

5️⃣ Based on WAF result:

- **Allow**: ALB forwards the request to target group (EC2, ECS, etc.)
- **Block**: ALB immediately responds to client with 403 Forbidden
- **CAPTCHA/Challenge**: ALB handles CAPTCHA flow before forwarding

6️⃣ If allowed, target server handles the request and responds back through ALB

7️⃣ ALB returns the response to the client

    participant Client
    participant ALB (Elastic Load Balancer)
    participant AWS WAF (Web ACL)
    participant Target Application (EC2 / ECS / Lambda)

    Client->>ALB: Send HTTP/S request
    ALB->>WAF: Internally invoke WAF evaluation
    WAF->>ALB: Decision (Allow, Block, CAPTCHA)
    alt Request Allowed
        ALB->>Target Application: Forward request
        Target Application-->>ALB: Send response
        ALB-->>Client: Return response
    else Request Blocked
        ALB-->>Client: Return 403 Forbidden
    else CAPTCHA Required
        ALB-->>Client: Issue CAPTCHA Challenge
        Client->>ALB: Solve CAPTCHA and re-submit
        ALB->>WAF: Re-evaluate request
        ALB->>Target Application: If passed, forward request
    end
```

## 🔥 **Real-World Example**

Imagine your website uses:

- **CloudFront** → (optional)
- **ALB** → **EC2 instances**

You attach **AWS WAF Web ACL** to ALB to block:

- SQL Injection attempts
- Bots
- Rate limit (e.g., no more than 1000 requests/minute/IP)

**Result**:

- If attacker tries SQLi: **WAF blocks before the EC2 instance even sees it**.
- If normal user accesses: **Request is allowed and forwarded to EC2**.

✅ **Your app remains safe**, **fast**, and **not overloaded**.

## 🏆 **Final Smart Pro Tip**

> 🧠 **Always attach AWS WAF Web ACL to the ALB** itself.  
> Don’t rely on adding external proxies unless needed — AWS gives you native integration with ALB + WAF without any DNS, routing, or architecture change.
