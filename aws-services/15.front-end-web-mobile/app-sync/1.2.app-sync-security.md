# 🔐 **AppSync – Security & Authorization Strategies**

AWS **AppSync** provides flexible and secure authentication & authorization mechanisms to control how clients access your **GraphQL API**. Whether you're building a public, mobile, enterprise, or multi-tenant app, AppSync gives you **4 powerful authorization modes**—customizable per field, query, or API level.

---

## 🧱 **AppSync Authorization Modes**

Each request to your GraphQL endpoint must be authorized using **one or more of these strategies**:

| 🔒 Mode                     | 📌 Description                                                             |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `API_KEY`                   | Simple key-based access. Best for public or prototype APIs.                |
| `AWS_IAM`                   | IAM-based access (users, roles). Ideal for backend services, CLI, Lambda.  |
| `OPENID_CONNECT`            | Auth via 3rd-party OIDC providers (e.g., Auth0, Google, Azure AD)          |
| `AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS` | User sign-in with Cognito (OAuth2, social login, federated IdP, MFA, etc.) |

You can **combine multiple auth types** for maximum flexibility and assign each **field or operation** to a specific strategy!

---

## 1️⃣ **API_KEY (Simple Auth)**

- 🔑 Use an API Key with limited TTL (default: 7 days, max: 365 days)
- 🔓 Suitable for **dev/test, public read-only access**, quick MVPs
- 🚫 NOT recommended for production writes or sensitive data

```graphql
Authorization: API_KEY xxxxxxxx
```

⚠️ Rate limits and API key expiration must be managed carefully.

---

## 2️⃣ **AWS_IAM (IAM Roles & Policies)**

- 🛡️ Secure access for **backend services** (Lambda, EC2, CLI, other AWS accounts)
- ✅ Uses **SigV4** signing via IAM roles or federated users
- 🔄 Great for **cross-account access** and private microservices

```sh
aws appsync graphql-api invoke --auth-type AWS_IAM
```

✅ Highly secure — enforced through IAM policies.

---

## 3️⃣ **OPENID_CONNECT (OIDC Providers)**

- 🔗 Authenticate using **any OIDC-compliant identity provider**

  - Google, Azure AD, Okta, Auth0, etc.

- 🪙 Client sends a JWT token in the request
- 🔐 AppSync validates token against provider's public keys

```http
Authorization: Bearer <OIDC-JWT-Token>
```

🔍 Use for **SaaS tenants, enterprise SSO, or multi-provider auth**.

---

## 4️⃣ **AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS (OAuth2)**

- 👤 Full-featured user management

  - Signup, Sign-in, Forgot Password, MFA, OAuth2, Federated Login

- 🎯 Best suited for **mobile/web apps with user authentication**
- 🔐 Fine-grained control using Cognito **groups, claims, and identity tokens**

```graphql
Authorization: Bearer <Cognito-ID-Token>
```

🔄 Seamless integration with **AppSync, Lambda, and ALB**.

---

## ⚡ **Field-Level Authorization (with @auth directive)**

With **AWS Amplify or schema directives**, you can lock down fields by:

```graphql
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }, { allow: groups, groups: ["Admin"] }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  content: String
  owner: String
}
```

- ✅ Only owners can edit their post
- ✅ Admins can access everything

---

## 🌐 **HTTPS + Custom Domains**

AppSync endpoints are **HTTPS-only**, but to use **custom domains**, you must:

- ✅ Set up a **CloudFront distribution** in front of AppSync
- ✅ Attach **ACM certificate** (must be in `us-east-1`)
- ✅ Use Lambda\@Edge if you need **header manipulation or token injection**

---

## 🛠️ **Best Practices for AppSync Security**

| ✅ Practice                        | 💡 Why It Matters                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prefer `IAM` or `Cognito` for prod | They provide strong identity and fine-grained access control     |
| Rotate `API_KEY` frequently        | Prevent abuse and minimize the impact of leaked credentials      |
| Enable **field-level** auth        | Enforce different permissions per query/mutation/field           |
| Use **custom CloudFront domain**   | For enhanced branding, HTTPS enforcement, and WAF integration    |
| Validate claims in resolvers       | Add **extra validation** logic with **Velocity Templates (VTL)** |

## 🏁 **Summary: Choose the Right Auth for Your Use Case**

| Use Case                    | Recommended Auth                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Public read-only APIs       | `API_KEY`                           |
| Backend AWS services        | `AWS_IAM`                           |
| SSO with corporate identity | `OPENID_CONNECT`                    |
| Mobile/web app users        | `COGNITO_USER_POOLS`                |
| Multi-tenant SaaS platform  | `OIDC` or `Cognito` + custom claims |
