---

## 🧪 **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

Amplify supports automated **End-to-End (E2E) testing** during the **test phase** of your deployment pipeline. This helps ensure your app behaves correctly **before reaching production**.

---

### 🚦 Why Use E2E Testing in Amplify?

- ✔️ **Detect Bugs Early** – Catch regressions during the CI/CD process.
- ✔️ **Prevent Broken Releases** – Block deployments if tests fail.
- ✔️ **Run UI Tests Automatically** – No manual interaction required.
- ✔️ **Generate Rich Reports** – Use frameworks like **Cypress** + **Mochawesome** for visual test reports.

---

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

You define your test scripts inside `amplify.yml` under the `test` phase. The pipeline executes:

1. **preTest**: Starts the app and installs testing tools.
2. **test**: Runs your test suite (e.g., Cypress, Mocha).
3. **postTest**: Aggregates results, generates reports, and shuts down services.

---

### 🧾 amplify.yml Example (With Cypress & Mochawesome)

```yaml
test:
  phases:
    preTest:
      commands:
        - npm ci
        - npm install -g pm2
        - npm install -g wait-on
        - npm install mocha mochawesome mochawesome-merge
        - pm2 start npm -- start
        - wait-on http://localhost:3000
    test:
      commands:
        - "npx cypress run --reporter mochawesome"
    postTest:
      commands:
        - npx mochawesome-merge cypress/results/*.json > mochawesome.json
        - pm2 kill

artifacts:
  baseDirectory: cypress
  configFilePath: "**/mochawesome.json"
  files:
    - "**/*.png"
    - "**/*.mp4"
```
