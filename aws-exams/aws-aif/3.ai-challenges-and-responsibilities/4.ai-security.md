| Latency   | Speed of model predictions          |

---

### 2. Infrastructure Monitoring

📌 Watch everything under the hood:

| What to Monitor     | Why                                        |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| CPU / GPU Usage     | Detect resource bottlenecks or overuse     |
| Network Performance | Catch slowdowns or suspicious traffic      |
| Storage             | Detect anomalies in data access            |
| Logs                | Catch unexpected events or access patterns |

---

### 3. Responsible AI Metrics

📌 Besides performance:

- Monitor **Bias and Fairness** 📊.
- Monitor **Compliance and Responsible AI** standards ⚖️.

## 🔗 AWS Shared Responsibility Model (for AI Security)

📌 In AWS, **security is shared**:

| Party                                | Responsibility                                         |
| :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS (Security **of** the cloud)      | Protect hardware, software, networking, and facilities |
| Customer (Security **in** the cloud) | Data protection, access controls, model guardrails     |

📌 **Shared Controls**:

- Patch Management 🔄.
- Configuration Management 🛠️.
- Awareness & Training 🧑‍🏫.

📌 **Smart Reminder**:

> "**AWS secures the building; you secure what's inside.**" 🛡️🏢
