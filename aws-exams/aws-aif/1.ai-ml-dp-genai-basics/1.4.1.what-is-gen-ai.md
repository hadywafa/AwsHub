## ⚡ **What is the Transformer Model?**

✅ Transformers are **the backbone** of most Generative AI models today, including **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT.

✅ **Key Innovations**:

- Processes a **whole sentence at once**, **not word-by-word** 🧠 → Faster & more coherent.
- Understands **which words are important** to each other using **Self-Attention** 🔍.
- **Massively parallelizable** → Trains much faster than old methods.

✅ **How Transformers Work (Simplified)**:

```mermaid

    InputText[📝 Input Text] --> Embedding[🔡 Input Embedding]
    Embedding --> SelfAttention[👀 Self Attention]
    SelfAttention --> FeedForward[🔁 Feed Forward Network]
    FeedForward --> Encoder[🛠️ Encoder]
    Encoder --> Decoder[🛠️ Decoder]
    Decoder --> OutputEmbedding[🔡 Output Embedding]
    OutputEmbedding --> OutputSoftmax[🎯 Output Probabilities]
    OutputSoftmax --> FinalOutput[📝 Final Output]
```

✅ **Examples of Transformer-Based LLMs**:

- **Google BERT** 📖
- **OpenAI GPT models (GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-4o)** 🚀
- **ChatGPT** stands for:  
  🧠 **Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer**

## 🌀 **Diffusion Models (for Image Generation)**

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="images/diffusion-model.png" style="border-radius: 20px; ; width: 70%" alt="Diffusion Model for Image Generation" />
</div>

---

✅ **Diffusion Models** work differently than LLMs:

| Stage              | Explanation                                                       |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🌀 Forward Process | Gradually **adds noise** to an image (destroying it)              |
| 🔄 Reverse Process | **Learns how to "undo" noise** and recreate an image from scratch |

✅ **Simple Idea**:

- At training: Take a picture → add random noise → repeat until it’s all noise.
- At generation: Start from pure noise → reverse the noise → generate a **brand new image**!

✅ **Example**:  
**Stable Diffusion** — create an image of **"a cat working on a laptop"** from just text!

## 🔊🎨 **What are Multi-modal Models?**

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="images/multi-modal.png" style="border-radius: 20px; " alt="Multi-modal models accept and generate text, images, audio, and more" />
</div>

---

✅ **Multi-modal models** are even more **powerful**:

- They **accept multiple types of input**: text 📝, images 🖼️, audio 🔊.
- They **generate multiple types of output**: video 🎥, audio 🔊, text 📝.

✅ **Simple Example**:

- Upload a photo of a cat 🐱 + upload an audio clip 🗣️ → AI **generates a video** of the cat talking with the uploaded voice!

✅ **Examples**:

- **GPT-4o** → Understands text + images + audio → Outputs text, voice, or more!

## 🧠 **Humans are a Mix of AI Types!**

✅ Fun fact: **Our brains actually work a bit like a mixture of AI concepts**:
