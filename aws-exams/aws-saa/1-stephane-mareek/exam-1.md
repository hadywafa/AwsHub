> - Since the application replicates the dataset across instances, durability isnâ€™t a concern â€” which is important because instance store data is lost when an instance is stopped or terminated.
>
> - Instance Store volumes (a.k.a. ephemeral storage) are physically attached SSDs or NVMe devices, offering very high IOPS and low latency â€” ideal for high random I/O workloads.

### Q25

> - AWS Shield Advanced has a monthly subscription fee of \$3,000 per account per organization, regardless of how many resources are protected within that account.

| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Standard**  | \~\$0.023                      | **\$0.023**                               |
| **EFS Standard** | \~\$0.30                       | **\$0.30**                                |
| **EBS (gp2)**    | \~\$0.10 \* 100 GB provisioned | **\$10.00** (charged on provisioned size) |

### Q51

> - S3 One Zone-IA is Cheaper
>
>   - ~20% cheaper than S3 Standard-IA.
>   - Since the assets are re-creatable, the lower resilience of One Zone-IA (single AZ storage) is acceptable.
>
> - Minimum 30-Day Requirement
>
>   - S3 One Zone-IA has a 30-day minimum storage duration, so transitioning earlier (e.g., at 7 days) would incur early deletion charges.
>   - Therefore, waiting 30 days avoids penalties.
