## üõ°Ô∏è **Where This Matters Most**

Even if you‚Äôre doing **security testing**, AWS considers certain behavior **abuse** if:

- You **attack shared services or IPs** used by other customers
- You **don‚Äôt own** the resources you‚Äôre testing
- You **simulate attacks** like DDoS or port flooding ‚Äî even in dev environments

---

## üìû What Happens If AWS Detects Abuse?

- You may get an **abuse report** or **account warning**
- In serious cases, AWS may:
  - **Throttle** your resources
  - **Suspend** the affected instance or service
  - **Temporarily or permanently disable** your AWS account

---

## ‚úÖ What You Should Do Instead

1. **Only test services you own**
2. **Avoid disruptive behaviors** like DoS simulations or traffic floods
3. **Use AWS-approved pentesting services**
4. **Tag your resources** and notify your team if doing simulations
