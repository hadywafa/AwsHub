# 💰 AWS Savings Plans – With Simple Examples

## 🧠 What Are Savings Plans?

> AWS Savings Plans let you **save money** if you're willing to **commit** to spending a **fixed amount per hour** on AWS for **1 or 3 years**.

🛍️ It’s like a **subscription discount**:

> “I’ll spend \$3/hour for the next 12 months” → AWS gives you up to **72% off**!

## 🎯 When to Use

If you already know:

- You’ll use **EC2, Fargate, Lambda**, or **SageMaker**
- You want **long-term, predictable usage**
- You like **flexibility with discounts**

## 🏷️ Types of Savings Plans (with Examples)

### 🔹 1. EC2 Instance Savings Plan

**Save up to 72%** 💰

- Commit to using a **specific instance family** in a region (e.g. `m5`, `c5`)
- You can change size (m5.large → m5.2xlarge), OS (Linux, Windows), or AZ

📌 **Example:**

You commit to spend **\$2/hour** on `m5` instances in `us-east-1` for 1 year.  
You now get **discounted pricing** for:

- `m5.large`, `m5.xlarge`, `m5.4xlarge`
- In **any AZ**, with **any OS**  
  But only **`m5` family in `us-east-1`** is eligible.

### 🔹 2. Compute Savings Plan

**Save up to 66%** 💰

- Most flexible plan
- Use **any instance family**, **any region**, **any OS**
- Works across EC2, Lambda, and Fargate

📌 **Example:**

You commit to **\$3/hour** for 3 years.  
You can now:

- Run `t3.medium` in `us-west-2` 💻
- Run `m5.2xlarge` in `us-east-1`
- Use **Lambda functions** or **Fargate containers**  
  **All with the same discount.**

✅ Perfect if your usage spans many services or changes often.

### 🔹 3. SageMaker Savings Plan

- Tailored for **machine learning workloads**
- Supports **training**, **inference**, **hosting**
- Same logic: commit to \$/hour for 1 or 3 years

📌 **Example:**

You train ML models every week using SageMaker.  
By committing **\$1/hour**, you get a discount even if you use:

- `ml.c5.large` for training
- `ml.t3.medium` for hosting
