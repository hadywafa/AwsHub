## 🎯 Budget Types

| Type                  | What It Tracks                                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 💸 **Cost Budget**    | Total cost across all AWS services or filtered dimensions |
| ⚙️ **Usage Budget**   | Usage quantities (e.g., GB of storage, vCPU hours)        |
| 📉 **RI Utilization** | Are you using enough of your Reserved Instances?          |
| 💡 **Savings Plans**  | Are your Savings Plans being fully utilized?              |

> ✅ Great for keeping tabs on both **what you spend** and **how efficiently you’re using discounts**.

## 📬 Notifications

- Set up to **5 Amazon SNS notifications** per budget
- Choose thresholds like **80%, 100%, 120%** of your budget

## 🛠️ Budget Filters

Just like **Cost Explorer**, you can filter budgets by:

- Specific **AWS Service**
- **Linked Account** (in Organizations)
- **Tag** (e.g., `Project = AI`)
- **Purchase Option** (On-Demand, Reserved)
- **Instance Type** (e.g., `t3.medium`)
- **Region** or **Availability Zone**
- **API Operation**

> 🎯 This makes it perfect for tracking per-project, per-team, or per-region costs.

## 📊 Example Use Cases

### 🧪 **Project Budget**

> Monitor how much your dev team spends on training workloads

### 🏷️ **EC2 Reserved Instance Utilization**

> Ensure your RIs are actually used

- Budget Type: RI Utilization
