# ☁️ Five Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **🔄 On-Demand Self-Service**
   Users can get computing resources (like servers or storage) instantly without needing human help.

2. **🌐 Broad Network Access**
   Services are available over the internet and can be used on any device (PC, phone, tablet).

3. **🏢 Multi-Tenancy & Resource Pooling**
   Many users share the same physical resources securely — like apartments in a building.

4. **📈 Rapid Elasticity & Scalability**
   Resources scale up or down automatically depending on demand — like stretching a rubber band.

5. **📊 Measured Service**
   Usage is tracked, and users are billed only for what they consume — like electricity.
