## 📈 4 Phases of Transformation

_How You Go from Idea to Cloud Success!_

When a company starts its cloud journey, here’s the path they usually take:

1. **Envision** → Dream big. What can cloud help us do better?
1. **Align** → What are we missing? What skills or tools do we need?
1. **Launch** → Try a small project (pilot) to test the waters.
1. **Scale** → It worked! Now go big across the company.
