# 📚 ML Algorithms – Unsupervised Learning

## 🧠 What is Unsupervised Learning?

> **Official Definition**:  
> **Unsupervised Learning** is a type of Machine Learning where the model **analyzes input data without labeled outputs** and tries to **discover patterns, structures, or relationships** hidden inside the data.

📌 **In simpler words**:  
Unsupervised learning is like **exploring a new jungle 🐒🌳 without a map** —  
The machine **groups or finds insights** from the data **without being told what's what**.

📌 **Key Characteristics**:

- No output labels during training ❌.
- Model **groups, detects, or summarizes** the data.
- Humans may later **analyze and label the discovered groups**.

## 🌟 Why Do We Need Unsupervised Learning?

📌 **Because**:

- In real life, most data is **unlabeled** 📦.
- It's **expensive and time-consuming** to label everything manually 🕰️💰.
- Machines can **spot hidden patterns** we might miss! 🔍

📌 **Common Goals**:

- Discover customer segments.
- Find unusual behaviors (like fraud).
- Recommend products or content.

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering in Unsupervised Learning

📌 Even in Unsupervised Learning, **Feature Engineering** is **super important** to improve results!

📌 **Examples**:

| Data Type           | Feature Engineering                                             |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structured (Tables) | - Normalize values<br>- Create ratios like "purchase frequency" |
| Text                | - Extract keywords using TF-IDF 📚                              |
| Images              | - Extract patterns like edges using CNNs 🖼️                     |

📌 **Why?**
