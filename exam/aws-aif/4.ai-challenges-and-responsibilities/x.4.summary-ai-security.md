## 🔎 Secure Data Engineering Best Practices

| Practice             | Why It Matters                                 |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Data Quality Check   | Data must be clean, diverse, current           |
| Privacy Enhancements | Masking, obfuscation, encryption, tokenization |
| Access Control       | Use roles, least privilege, MFA                |
| Data Integrity       | Maintain audit trails, backup plans            |

✅ **Simple Rule**:

> "**Good data = Good AI security.**" 📈
