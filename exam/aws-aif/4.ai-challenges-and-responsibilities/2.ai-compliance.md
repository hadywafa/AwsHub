## ⚠️ Common AI Compliance Challenges

| Challenge                | Real-World Meaning                                     |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 Complexity & Opacity  | Black-box models make it hard to explain decisions     |
| 🔄 Dynamism              | AI changes as data changes (hard to freeze a snapshot) |
| ⚙️ Emergent Capabilities | AI may do things it wasn’t explicitly trained for      |
| ⚠️ Unique Risks          | Privacy leaks, unfair decisions, misinformation        |

📌 **Types of Bias**:

| Bias Type        | Description                                                   |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Algorithmic Bias | Model trained on biased data continues the bias               |
| Human Bias       | Developer unknowingly bakes personal bias into data or design |

📌 **Smart Rule**:

> "**Compliance isn’t just code — it's also people and data.**" 🧑‍💻📊
