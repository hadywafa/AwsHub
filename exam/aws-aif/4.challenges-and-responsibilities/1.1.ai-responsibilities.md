## 🧩 Interpretability vs Explainability

| Term             | Meaning                                                                           |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interpretability | You fully understand "how" decisions are made                                     |
| Explainability   | You understand "what" and "why" outcomes happen, without seeing all inner details |

✅ **Simple**:

- Interpretability = X-ray inside the brain 🧠.
- Explainability = Understand behavior without surgery.

✅ **Trade-off**:

- More Interpretability → Usually less model power.

---

## 🌳 High Interpretability Example: Decision Trees

- Simple rules like "If income > \$50K, approve loan."
- Easy to **read** and **understand** 🌳✅.
- Risk: Overfitting if too many branches 🌳🌳🌳.

---

## 📈 Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)

- Show how **one feature** affects **prediction**.
- Useful when model is a black box (like Neural Networks).

✅ **Example**:

- "How much does income alone affect loan approval?"

---

## 🧍‍♂️ Human-Centered Design (HCD) for AI

Design AI systems that:

- Help humans make better decisions ✅.
- Are simple, clear, and usable ✅.
- Are free from bias ✅.
- Learn and adapt to human needs ✅.
